Looking at the growing concern aboutthe environment and sustainability, such nanomaterials find many applications in a wide range ofdomains that influence our society and our way of life. The improvement in properties and thediscovery of new functionalities are key goals that cannot be reached without a well controlledand better understanding of the preparation, characterization, and manufacturing of new hybridnanomaterials, which constitute the starting points of the design of specific and adequate systems.The investigation of nanocellulose/nanocarbons hybrid materials has demonstrated both academicand technological importance and offered great research opportunities within cross-disciplinaryareas. Nanocellulose, which refers to the cellulose with a nanoscale dimension, encompasses cellulosenanocrystals, cellulose nanofibrils, and bacterial cellulose. It displays outstanding features such asbiocompatibility, eco-friendliness, renewability, interesting reinforcing potential, hydrogen-bondingcapacity, low thermal expansion coefficient, dimensional stability, high elastic modulus, high specificsurface area, and low density. Various nanocellulose-based composites, which found application indifferent fields, have been developed during the last two decades. However, numerous challengesneed to be addressed to achieve the full requirement of advanced materials. Accordingly, severalresearch activities continue to be performed by different research groups worldwide to develop thenext generation of nanomaterials and fully explore the potential of nanocellulose. Nanocarbon isanother exciting type of potential nanomaterials, which has received tremendous attention sincethe discovery of fullerenes over thirty years ago. They include carbon nanotubes, graphene andcarbon dots. They exhibit outstanding thermal, electrical, optical and mechanical features, and theycan be employed in a wide range of applications such as composites, microelectronics, biomedical,conductive films, sensors, adsorbents, catalysis, energy storage, and coatings, among others. Basedon these premises, the present book aims to further contribute to the momentum of research anddevelopment in nanocellulose/nanocarbon hybrids, by featuring several different chapters authoredand reviewed by experts in the field. This book targets a broad readership of materials scientists,chemists, physicists, and nanotechnologists, among others. Most of the chapters highlight theoreticalconcepts and practical approaches of interest for real-world applications related to nanocelluloseand nanocarbons.In summary, this book advances not only our understanding of the emerging and significantrole of nanocellulose and nanocarbons in several fields, but also of the challenges and future researchdirections needed to fully explore their outstanding features in practical ways. It is also expected thatthis book will encourage multidisciplinary research activities on hybrid bio-nanomaterials, extendingthe range of potential practical applications taking into account the scaling-up of the systems, theeconomic viability, the impact on the environment and human health as well as the long-term stabilityand recyclability.Djalal Trache, Vijay Kumar ThakurEditorsixnanomaterialsEditorialNanocellulose and Nanocarbons Based HybridMaterials: Synthesis, Characterizationand ApplicationsDjalal Trache 1,* and Vijay Kumar Thakur 2,31 Energetic Materials Laboratory, Teaching and Research Unit of Energetic Processes,Ecole Militaire Polytechnique, BP 17, Bordj El-Bahri, Algiers 16046, Algeria2 Biorefining and Advanced Materials Research Center, Scotland’s Rural College (SRUC), Kings Buildings,Edinburgh EH9 3JG, UK; vijay.kumar@sruc.ac.uk3 Department of Mechanical Engineering, School of Engineering, Shiv Nadar University,Uttar Pradesh 201314, India* Correspondence: djalaltrache@gmail.comReceived: 2 September 2020; Accepted: 7 September 2020; Published: 10 September 2020Since the emergence of nanotechnology in recent decades, the development and design of hybridbio-nanomaterials has become an important field of research. Looking at the growing concern aboutthe environment and sustainability, such nanomaterials find many applications in a wide range ofdomains that influence our society and our way of life [1]. The improvement in properties andthe discovery of new functionalities are key goals that cannot be reached without a well-controlledand better understanding of the preparation, characterization, and manufacturing of new hybridnanomaterials, which constitute the starting points of the design of specific and adequate systems [2,3].Investigation of nanocellulose/nanocarbons hybrid materials has demonstrated both academic andtechnological importance and offered great research opportunities within cross-disciplinary areas.Nanocellulose, which refers to the cellulose with a nanoscale dimension, encompasses cellulosenanocrystals, cellulose nanofibrils, and bacterial cellulose [4,5]. It displays outstanding features suchas biocompatibility, eco-friendliness, renewability, interesting reinforcing potential, hydrogen-bondingcapacity, low thermal expansion coefficient, dimensional stability, high elastic modulus, high specificsurface area, and low density [6–9]. Various nanocellulose-based composites, which found applicationin different fields, have been developed during the last two decades. However, numerous challengesneed to be addressed to achieve the full requirement of advanced materials [10–14]. Accordingly,several research activities continue to be performed by different research groups worldwide to developthe next generation of nanomaterials and fully explore the potential of nanocellulose.Nanocarbon is another exciting type of potential nanomaterials, which has received tremendousattention since the discovery of fullerenes over thirty years ago [15–18]. They include carbon nanotubes,graphene and carbon dots. They exhibit outstanding thermal, electrical, optical and mechanicalfeatures, and they can be employed in a wide range of applications such as composites, microelectronics,biomedical, conductive films, sensors, adsorbents, catalysis, energy storage, and coating, among others.Based on these premises, the present Special Issue in Nanomaterials aims to further contribute tothe momentum of research and development in nanocellulose/nanocarbon hybrids, by featuring ten(10) original research articles as well as two (2) review articles, authored and reviewed by experts in thefield. It targets a broad readership of materials scientists, chemists, physicists, and nanotechnologists,among others. Most of the research papers highlight theoretical concepts and practical approaches ofinterest for real-world applications related to nanocellulose and nanocarbons.Some interesting research works dealing with nanocellulose-based materials have been publishedin the present Special Issue. Imtiaz et al. prepared wood-based cationic cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs)and assessed their cytotoxicity as potential immunomodulators [19]. They firstly transformed anionicNanomaterials 2020, 10, 1800; doi:10.3390/nano10091800 www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials1Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 1800CNCs to cationic CNCs with a rod-like shape through the grafting of cationic polymers containingpendant +NMe3 and +NH3. The authors proved that such an interesting cellulosic derivative,which exhibited very low toxicity, is considered as a good candidate as an immunomodulator andas vaccine nano-adjuvants. In another work, Han et al. investigated the physicochemical propertiesof cationic nanocellulose (cationic NC) and starch nanocomposites [20]. The authors preparedcationic NC from cationic-modified microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) using different approaches, i.e.,acid hydrolysis, high-pressure homogenization, and high-intensity ultrasonication. They demonstratedthat the nanocomposite prepared by cationic-NC produced by high-pressure homogenization andstarch displayed a good dispersion, better thermal stability and the best water vapor barrierproperties compared to other nanocomposites, which suggest that such nanocomposite can findpotential application as a biodegradable food-packaging material. The study by Sharma et al.assessed the potential of carboxy cellulose nanofibers (CNF) extracted from untreated jute biomassusing nitro-oxidation method as the reinforcing agent of natural rubber latex (NRL) [21]. It wasrevealed that the incorporation of CNF into NRL enhanced the mechanical characteristics even in thenon-vulcanized state for which the optimal amount of CNF is around 0.2 wt.%. Another paper by Haiet al. describes the preparation and characterization of cellulose nanofibers and chitosan nanofiberblends, which are expected to be applied for active food packaging [22]. The obtained nanocompositedisplayed a remarkable improvement in the mechanical features. The higher content of chitosannanofibers exhibited higher antioxidant activity, better UV-light protection, increased water vaportransmission rate, and better mechanical properties. They claimed that such a nanocomposite couldbe useful for active food packaging application. The report by Lu et al. describes the preparationof a nanocellulose/metal-organic-framework-derived carbon-doped CuO/Fe3O4 nanocomposite viadirect calcination [23]. Its catalytic efficiency through the reduction in 4-nitrophenol, methylene blue,and methyl orange has been demonstrated.Similarly, interesting nanocarbon-based materials have been also reported in the presentSpecial Issue. One research article focused on the reinforcement of high-molecular-weight,multimodal, high-density polyethylene by microwave-induced plasma graphene platelets using meltintercalation [24]. It was found that graphene platelets were homogenously distributed and dispersedwithin the polymer matrix through a strong interfacial bonding. The developed nanocompositesexhibited better thermal stability and interesting mechanical features. In another study, Sharma et al.developed a now-reduced graphene oxide incorporated gun tragacanth-cl-N, N-dimethylacrylamidehydrogel composite as a reusable adsorbent for Hg2+ and Cr6+ ions [25]. The authors optimizedthe experimental conditions of the synthesis based on the microwave-assisted method. It is provedthat the adsorption effectiveness of 99% and 82% were obtained for Hg2+ and Cr6+ ions, respectively,confirming that the developed adsorbents are highly efficient and can be employed for environmentalremediation applications. A pure nanocarbon hybrid based on multi-walled carbon nanotube andgraphene nanoplatelet (GNP) for flexible strain sensors has been developed by Huang et al. [26].The production of such hybrid was assisted with surfactant Triton X-100 and the sonication through avacuum filtration process. The authors revealed that the increase in the content of GNP from 0 to 5%decreased the tensile strength of the hybrid film, whereas the electrical conductivity increased. It isalso found that the increase of the GNP content leads to an increase in the strain sensitivity with goodstability and repeatability.Considered as a promising class of nanomaterials, the combination of nanocellulose andnanocarbon has received tremendous interest in recent years. This interest is promoted by theexceptional properties and outstanding synergetic effects that these powerful nanomaterials offer,which allow developing new opportunities and ways for the preparation and employment ofnovel materials in nanotechnology spanning from water treatment, energy and environment,optics and photonics, medical, biosensing and optoelectronics. For such specific nanohybrids,two review papers and two research articles have been published. The first review articlecompiles five years of recent research findings on new development on the emerging generation of2Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 1800cellulose nanocrystals/graphene-based nanomaterials [27]. The methodologies of their production,their properties and applications have been thoroughly discussed. It is demonstrated that suchnano-hybrids exhibited prominent innovative features due to synergetic effects, which are unachievableby taking cellulose nanocrystals and graphene-based nanomaterials separately. The authors reportedthat the real use of such hybrids as the next generation of materials necessitates more efforts andfurther improvements in functionality and performance, in addition, the decrease in the productioncosts and environmental impacts. The second review by Bacakova et al. is dedicated to the applicationof nanocellulose (nanofibrils and nanocrystals)/nanocarbon (fullerenes, graphene, nanotubes andnanodiamonds) composites with a special focus on biotechnology and medicine [28]. Such promisinghybrids displayed unique features such as high mechanical strength coupled with flexibility andstretchability, shape memory effect, photodynamic and photothermal activity, electrical conductivity,semiconductivity, thermal conductivity, tunable optical transparency, intrinsic fluorescence andluminescence, and high adsorption and filtration capacity. They can be used in several applicationssuch as wound dressing, tissue engineering, electrical stimulation of damaged tissues, isolation ofdifferent biomolecules, drug delivery, among others. However, the authors claimed that the risk oftheir potential cytotoxicity and immulogenicity needs to be deeply investigated.The first research paper dealing with nanocellulose/nanocarbon hybrids is studied by Yu et al. [29].These authors prepared cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs)/carbon nanomaterial hybrid aerogels for adsorptionremoval of cationic and anionic organic dyes. They employed two classes of nanocarbons, i.e.,carbon nanotubes (CNT) and graphene nanoplates (GnP), which are combined with different amountsof CNFs. They reported that the combination CNFs: GnP 3:1 provided the best performance towardday adsorption for which the pseudo-second-adored kinetic and monolayer Langmuir adsorptionisotherm are followed. The authors claimed that such a hybrid could find promising application as anadsorption material for wastewater treatment. The last work presented in the Special Issue studiedby Wang et al. describes the preparation and characterization of self-healable electro-conductivehydrogels based on core-shell structured nanocellulose/carbon nanotubes hybrids, expected to be usedas flexible supercapacitors [30]. The developed hydrogel exhibited interesting mechanical features,high water-content, excellent flexibility, self-healing capability, higher electrical conductivity and specificcapacity, rendering it a potential candidate for advanced personalized wearable electronic devices.In summary, the present Special Issue advances not only our understanding of the emergingand significant role of nanocellulose and nanocarbons in several fields, but also of the challenges andfuture research directions needed to fully explore their outstanding features in practical ways. It isalso expected that this Special Issue will encourage multidisciplinary research activities on hybridbio-nanomaterials, extending the range of potential practical applications taking into account thescaling-up of the systems, the economic viability, the impact on the environment and human health aswell as the long-term stability and recyclability.Author Contributions: All authors contributed to the editorial.

Modulationof the immune system plays a crucial role in physiological processes as well as in the treatmentand/or prevention of autoimmune and infectious diseases. Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) are derivedfrom cellulose, the most abundant polysaccharide on the earth. CNCs are an emerging class ofcrystalline nanomaterials with exceptional physico-chemical properties for high-end applicationsand commercialization prospects. The aim of this study was to design, synthesize, and evaluate thecytotoxicity of a series of biocompatible, wood-based, cationic CNCs as potential immunomodulators.The anionic CNCs were rendered cationic by grafting with cationic polymers having pendant +NMe3and +NH3 moieties. The success of the synthesis of the cationic CNCs was evidenced by Fouriertransform infrared spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, zeta potential, and elemental analysis.No modification in the nanocrystals rod-like shape was observed in transmission electron microscopyand atomic force microscopy analyses. Cytotoxicity studies using three different cell-based assays(MTT, Neutral Red, and LIVE/DEAD®) and three relevant mouse and human immune cells indicatedvery low cytotoxicity of the cationic CNCs in all tested experimental conditions. Overall, our resultsshowed that cationic CNCs are suitable to be further investigated as immunomodulators and potentialvaccine nanoadjuvants.Keywords: cellulose nanocrystals; immunomodulator; synthesis; polymerization; characterization;cytotoxicity1. IntroductionPolysaccharides, such as 2,3-O-acetylated-1,4-β-D-glucomannan, have been shown to haveimmunomodulatory properties, including the stimulation of cytokines, interleukin 1-beta (IL–1β),and tumor necrosis alpha (TNF-α) in human cell lines [1,2]. The immune system is a complex networkof different cell types and mediators responsible for the defense of an organism against pathogens aswell as the maintenance of tolerance to innocuous antigens [3]. Immunomodulation plays a crucialrole in physiological processes as well as in the treatment and/or prevention of several diseases,including infectious diseases. Therefore, studies focusing on polysaccharide-based nanomaterialswith immunomodulatory activities can have an important impact on development of novel vaccineadjuvants. Adjuvants, in the context of vaccines, are defined as components capable of enhancingand/or shaping antigen-specific immune responses [4]. Advances in particle engineering allowNanomaterials 2020, 10, 1603; doi:10.3390/nano10081603 www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials7Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 1603the design of new nanomaterials with desired physico-chemical properties, such as composition,size, shape, surface characteristics, and degradability [5], which ultimately will impact their effectas immunomodulators. It is well known that cationic substances, especially particulate materials,can act as immunomodulators [6,7]. In fact, the immunostimulatory activity of cationic cellulosenanocrystals (CNCs) was first described in our previous work in which we found that they induced thesecretion of the inflammatory cytokine, IL-1β, in mouse and human macrophage cells [8,9]. CNCs areelongated crystalline rod-like (or needle-like) nanoparticles derived from the most abundant naturalbiopolymer on earth, cellulose [10–12]. CNCs are green and biocompatible materials with uniquephysico-chemical properties, including high aspect ratio, low density, large specific surface area,tunable surface chemistry (presence of abundant hydroxyl groups), non-toxic, colloidal stability, andoptical and mechanical properties. These favorable features make CNCs as attractive nanoscalematerials for applications in various fields such as biomedical, pharmaceutical, nanocomposites,electronics, among many others [13–15]. CNCs can be manufactured on a large scale and a recentstudy showed that the current standing of industrially produced CNCs was positive, indicating thatthe evolution of commercial-scale applications would not be hindered by CNCs production [16].The emerging interest in CNCs for biomedical purposes led us to synthesize a novel functionalizedseries of wood-based CNCs possessing surface positive charges with potential immunomodulatoryactivities that could hopefully be further developed in newly engineered vaccine nanoadjuvants.For applications that required a positively charged CNCs surface, synthetic routes for cationization ofCNCs were developed such as nucleophilic ring-opening of epoxide, esterification, copper(I)-catalyzed1,3-cycloaddition and surface initiated-atom transfer radical polymerization [17–22]. In this work,we reported the design, synthesis, characterization and cytotoxicity of wood-based cationic CNCsas potential immunomodulators. A series of colloidally stable cationic CNCs was prepared viasurface-initiated single electron transfer living radical polymerization (SI-SET-LRP) technique withdifferent sizes and surface charges. The choice of [2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl] trimethylammoniumchloride (METAC) and aminoethyl methacrylate hydrochloride (AEM) monomers with pendantcationic groups (+NMe3 and +NH3 respectively) was guided in part due to a recent study highlightingthe use of NH2-functionalized aluminum oxyhydroxide nanorods for an enhanced immune adjuvantactivity [7]. In addition to an effective synthetic route and sound physico-chemical characterization,another important aspect for the potential application of these cationic CNCs as vaccine nanoadjuvantis safety of these nanomaterials. In general, vaccine adjuvant should not induce an overwhelmingimmune response, otherwise it would have a toxic effect. Therefore, the cytotoxicity of these cationicCNCs was evaluated using three different cell-based assays (MTT, Neutral Red, and LIVE/DEAD®)and relevant immune cells, including two mouse cell lines (J774A.1 and BV2) as well as humanperipheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Overall, we successfully synthesized and characterizeda series of cationic CNCs that showed very low cytotoxicity in all tested experimental conditionsindicating that these cationic cellulose-based nanomaterials are suitable to be further investigated asimmunomodulators and potential vaccine nanoadjuvants.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Materials and ReagentsSpray-dried sulfated CNCs (prepared by sulfuric acid mediated hydrolysis of hardwood pulp)was kindly supplied by InnoTech Alberta Inc (Edmonton, AB, Canada). The spray-dried CNCpowder was stored at 4 ◦C and used as obtained. Triethylamine (TEA), 4-dimethyl-aminopyridine(DMAP), 2-bromoisobutyryl bromide, N,N,N′,N”,N”-pentamethyldiethylenetriamine (PMDETA),copper (I) bromide, [2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl] trimethylammonium chloride (METAC) (75 wt% inH2O), 2-aminoethyl methacrylate hydrochloride (AEM), 2,2′-bipyridyl (bpy), methanol, ethanol,tetrahydrofuran (THF), acetone, and potassium bromide (KBr) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich(St Louis, MO, USA).8Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 16032.2. Synthesis of Wood-Based Cationic CNCsThe initiator modified CNC materials (CNC-BriB) were first synthesized according to ourpreviously reported procedure with slight modifications [23]. Pristine spray-dried CNCs were reactedwith 2-bromoisobutyryl bromide (BriB bromide) at two different ratios with respect to anhydroglucoseunits (AGU) in CNCs ([Br]/[AGU]), 5:3 for CNC-BriB-1 and 5:12 for CNC-BriB-2 (for a detailedexperimental procedure of CNC-BriB, refer to SI & Supplementary Figure S1). CNC-BriB was thengrafted with either poly (METAC) or poly (AEM) via SI-SET-LRP at different ratios of monomer toAGU such as [METAC/AGU] = 50:3 or 60:3 and [AEM/AGU] = 50:3 (Table 1). A general procedure forthe preparation of cationic CNCs is as follows: CNC-BriB (350 mg) was dispersed in a MeOH:H2Osolvent mixture (100 mL, 1:1 v/v) in a 250 mL Schlenk flask. The reaction mixture was degassed underN2 gas for 45 min prior to the addition of the monomer METAC or AEM (50 and/or 60 mmol) andcopper (I) bromide (0.5 mmol). The suspension was degassed again before addition of bpy or PMDETA(1 mmol) and the reaction mixture was vigorously stirred at room temperature for 24 h. The resultingcrude cationic CNC was then centrifuged (3 × 12,000 rpm at 10 ◦C for 30 min) with a 1:3 ratio ofH2O:MeOH. The residual solid was resuspended in water and extensively dialyzed (MWCO 3500 Da)against deionized water for 1 week with daily constant change of water. The suspension was thenfreeze-dried to afford purified CNCs as white flaky material. The syntheses of other cationic CNCs aredescribed in detail in the supporting information and Supplementary Table S1.Table 1. Different molar ratios of [Br]/[AGU] and [monomer]/[AGU] for the fabrication of cationic CNCs.Sample [Br]/[AGU] [Monomer]/[AGU]CNC-METAC-1A 5:3 50:3CNC-METAC-1B 5:3 60:3CNC-METAC-2A 5:12 50:3CNC-METAC-2B 5:12 60:3CNC-AEM-1A 5:3 50:3CNC-AEM-2A 5:12 50:32.3. Characterization of Pristine and Modified CNCs2.3.1. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR)FTIR spectra of pristine spray dried sulfated CNCs and lyophilized esterified and cationic CNCswere recorded on a PerkinElmer FTIR spectrophotometer (Spectrum Two) (Norwalk, CT, USA) at roomtemperature. KBr pellets were prepared by grinding in a mortar and compressing about 2% of theCNC samples in KBr (previously well-dried in an oven). Background measurement using a neat KBrpellet was first obtained to correct for light scattering losses in the pellet and any water absorbed byKBr. Spectra in the range of 4000–400 cm−1 were obtained with a resolution of 4 cm−1 by cumulating32 scans.2.3.2. Zeta Potential and Dynamic Light ScatteringZeta (ζ-) potential and dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements were conducted using aMalvern Zetasizer Nano ZS instrument (model: ZEN3600; Malvern Instruments Inc., Westborough,MA, USA). This instrument is equipped with a 4.0 mW helium-neon laser (λ=633 nm) and an avalanchephotodiode detector and works at a 173◦ scattering angle. A 0.25 wt% CNC dispersion in Milli-Q waterwas used for zeta potential while for DLS, the hydrodynamic apparent particle size was measured fora 0.05 wt% CNC dispersion in Milli-Q water. Prior measurements, the suspensions were sonicated andfiltered through a 0.45 μm filter membrane and analyses were performed immediately at 25 ◦C. For DLSresults, triplicate samples were measured 12 times each and the average particle size distribution wasobtained. The standard deviation was reported as the error for the measurements. Results for zetapotential measurements were recorded in triplicate and the averages were reported.9Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 16032.3.3. Elemental AnalysisCarbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and sulfur content by mass for freeze-dried pristine and cationic CNCsamples were determined using Thermo Scientific Flash 2000 Organic Elemental Analyzer. Analysis(Edmonton, AB, Canada) was performed in duplicate and the averages were reported.2.3.4. Transmission Electron MicroscopyTransmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of pristine and cationic CNC samples wereobtained using Hitachi H-7500 operating at 80 kV in HR mode. All samples were prepared at 0.1 mg/mLin double distilled water and bath sonicated for 15 min at room temperature prior to the sampleimmobilization on TEM grids. 6 μL of sample were deposited on the TEM grid (Cu-300CN, PacificGrid-Tech, San Francisco, CA, USA) with excess solution removed by using the edge of a wet filterpaper. Samples were stained in 1 wt% phosphotungstic acid (PTA) in water (pH 7) for 60 s andair-dried in the dark prior to the TEM analysis. The samples were observed in the magnification rangeof 40,000–600,000 Å in order to provide enough information about sample purity and morphology.2.3.5. Atomic Force MicroscopyAtomic force microscopy (AFM) micrographs of pristine and cationic CNCs were obtained usinga Nanoscope IV (Digital Instruments Veeco, Santa Barbara, CA, USA) with a silicon tip operated intapping mode. Particle analysis of the micrographs was performed using the software Scanning ProbeImage ProcessorTM (5.0.8.0; Image Metrology, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark)2.4. Cytotoxicity Studies2.4.1. Preparation of the Colloidal Suspension of CNCs for Cell-Based AssaysFor cytotoxicity assays, the CNC suspensions were prepared at 1 mg/mL in ultrapure water.The CNC suspensions were vortexed for 15 s, sonicated for 2 min at 70 output, followed by filtrationwith 0.45 μm polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filter and autoclaved at 121 ◦C, 15 psi for 30 min.The suspensions were aliquoted and kept at −20 ◦C for future use.2.4.2. Cell Culture and Experimental ConditionsMouse macrophage-like cell line (J774A.1, Sigma) and BV2 cell line (murine microglia, kindlyprovided by Dr. Amy Ryan, SUNY Plattsburgh) were seeded at 3–5 × 105 cells/mL in 96 well plate(3–5 × 104 cells/well) using RPMI 1640 and DMEM medium (GIBCO), respectively. Both media weresupplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin, streptomycin, and l-glutamine. Both celllines were cultured at 37 ◦C in a 5% CO2-supplemented atmosphere for at least overnight before thetreatment with 10, 25, 50, and 100 μg/mL of CNCs. The peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)were extracted from Leukotrap blood filters from healthy blood donors. The Leukotrap filters wereobtained from UVM Health Network-CVPH North Country Regional Blood Center, Plattsburgh, NY.To retrieve blood cells, the filter was reverse flushed with 3 × 50 mL of calcium and magnesium-freePBS, followed by PBMCs isolation using a separation medium (LSM). Briefly, 4 mL of LSM was addedto a 15 mL conical centrifuge tube and 6 mL of 1:1 diluted blood in calcium and magnesium-freePBS was carefully layered on LSM, creating a sharp blood-LSM interface. The conical tubes werecentrifuged at 400× g at room temperature for 25 min. The top layer containing plasma was discardedand the mononuclear cell layer was carefully transferred to a clean tube and an equal volume ofcalcium and magnesium-free PBS was added. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 250× g to pelletcells and the cells were washed once in calcium and magnesium-free PBS and finally resuspended inRPMI medium for seeding. The PBMCs were seeded in 48 well plate at 1×106 cells/mL and cultured at37 ◦C in a 5% CO2-supplemented atmosphere for at least overnight before the treatment with 10, 25, 50,and 100 μg/mL of CNC derivatives.10Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 16032.4.3. Cell Viability AssaysAfter 24 h of treatment, the medium from J774A.1 and BV2 treated and non-treated(control) cells was removed, and 100 μL of fresh culture medium containing 500 μg/mL of3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) or 50 μg/mL of Neutral Red(NR) was added to each well to access cell viability. The MTT assay involves the conversion of the watersoluble MTT (yellow) by mitochondrial dehydrogenases in viable cells to a water-insoluble formazan(purple/blue) [24] while the NR assay is based on the ability of viable cells to incorporate and bind thedye neutral red in the lysosomes [25]. In both assays, the intensity of the color is directly proportionalto cell viability. The cells with MTT or NR loading medium were incubated for at 37 ◦C in a 5%CO2-supplemented atmosphere. After 30 min, the respective loading medium was removed, and theattached cells were gently washed once with PBS. To solubilize the formazan crystals, 100 μL/well ofdimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added and the absorbance was measured at 570 nm using a microplatereader (Synergy H1 Hybrid Multi-Mode, BioTek/Agilent, Winoosky, VT, USA). To extract NR dye fromlysosomes, 100 μL of acidified ethanol (1% glacial acetic acid, 50% aqueous ethanol) was added andthe plate was placed on the plate shaker for ~10–15 min with protection from light. The absorbance at540 nm and at 690 nm was measured in the microplate reader within 60 min of adding NR Desorbsolution. For calculations, 690 nm was subtracted from 540 nm. The non-treated cells (control) wereconsidered 100% of viable cells in both MTT and NR assays. For statistical significance, both cytotoxicityassays were repeated at least 3 times in triplicates.The LIVE/DEAD® viability assay is a quick and easy two-color assay to determine the viability ofcells in a population. Typical results will distinguish live cells which are stained with green-fluorescentcalcein-AM to indicate intracellular esterase activity, from dead cells that are stained with red-fluorescentethidium homodimer-1 to indicate loss of plasma membrane integrity. The assay was performedaccording to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, after 24 h treatment with respective CNCs,the cell culture medium was gently removed and 250 μL PBS, 2 μL of Calcein (40 μM) and 2 μL ofethidium homodimer-1 2 mM were added, mixed, and the cell suspension was incubated in the darkRT for 15 min. The loading solution was discarded and 250 μL of cold PBS + EDTA was added toeach well and the plate was placed on ice for 30 min to facilitate the release of PBMCs from the plate.The bottom of the wells was scraped with a pipette tip and the cells were removed by gentle pipettingup/down, 100 μL of the cell suspension was utilized to assess live and dead cells by flow cytometry(BD Accuri™ C6 cytometer, BD, Franklin Lake, NJ, USA) using FL-1 filter Calcein (green, live) andFL-2 filter Ethidium homodimer (red, dead). The percentage of labeled cells was calculated by BDAccuri software using H2O2 treated cells as positive control for gating dead cells. The calculated datawas expressed using the average of fold of change in the (%) of dead cells (ethidium bromide staining)corrected by (%) dead cells in the control (non-treated cells), from at least 4 experiments.2.4.4. Statistical AnalysisThe data were statistically analyzed by using the two-way analysis of variance test followed byDunnett’s multiple comparison test using GraphPad Prism version 8.2 software (San Diego, CA, USA).Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.01.3. Results and Discussion3.1. Synthesis and Characterization of Cationic CNCsCNCs with cationic polymer brushes were synthesized by grafting poly (METAC) or poly(AEM) viaSI-SET-LRP from the surface of pristine CNCs (Scheme 1). The first step required the covalent attachmentof an initiator on the surface of CNCs using a well-known esterification method of the hydroxyl groupsof CNCs with an acyl bromide [23,26,27]. CNC-initiator (CNC-BriB) were prepared at two differentinitiator loading capacity with respect to anhydroglucose units (AGU) in CNCs ([Br]/[AGU]), 5:3for CNC-BriB-1 and 5:12 for CNC-BriB-2). The next key step involved a grafting from approach to11Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 1603introduce cationic poly(METAC) or poly(AEM) brushes by SI-SET-LRP on CNCs under mild reactionconditions (Scheme 1B). SET-LRP is a robust and versatile polymerization technique for materialssynthesis [28] and had been previously used to graft thermoresponsive and methacrylamide-basedpolymers from the surface of CNCs [23,26,27,29]. A series of cationic CNCs was synthesized by varyingthe ratio between the immobilized initiator and the monomers (Table 1). After the polymerization,the resulting cationic CNCs were extensively purified by several centrifugations and dialysis over aweek to ensure the removal of unreacted materials or any trace impurities. Scheme 1. (A) chemical structure and schematic representation of pristine CNCs; (B) synthetic strategyfor the fabrication of a series of cationic CNCs.The success of the grafting of cationic brushes on the surface of CNCs was confirmed byFTIR spectroscopy, DLS, zeta potential and elemental analysis. Pristine CNCs displayed typical IRpeaks characteristic of cellulosic functional groups at 3000–3600 cm−1, 1645 cm−1 and 900–1150 cm−1corresponding to the -OH, -OH bending of water and -C-O-C vibrations, respectively [30,31] (Figure 1,spectrum A; Supplementary Figure S2). The spectra of CNCs after the polymerization showed anotable change with the appearance of new IR peaks at 1730 cm−1 and 1728 cm−1 for CNC-METAC-1A(Figure 1, spectrum B) and CNC-AEM-2A (Figure 1, spectrum C), respectively. These peaks wereattributed to the typical carbonyl stretching vibration (C = O) of ester moieties confirming the presenceof poly (METAC) and poly (AEM) on the surface of CNCs [27].12Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 1603 Figure 1. FTIR spectra of cationic CNCs: (A) pristine CNC, (B) CNC-METAC-1A, (C) CNC-AEM-2A.Dynamic light scattering (DLS) and zeta potential measurements were conducted to explore thesurface properties and stability of CNC suspensions before and after polymer grafting. Although theDLS technique is used for spherical particles, the measurements have been commonly employed tocompare the relative sizes of rod-like CNCs before and after a chemical modification as well as the stateof dispersion of the particles [16,21]. However, particle size measurements by DLS are not absoluteand should not be considered as the exact dimensions of pristine and modified CNCs. The apparenthydrodynamic diameter of CNC particles was obtained by DLS in water at a 0.05 wt% concentration.Pristine CNCs showed an apparent particle size of ~101 nm which is in close agreement with the dataobtained from AFM analysis (Figure 2D). An increase in apparent particle size was observed for allcationic CNCs (Table 2, Supplementary Figure S3) which indicated the presence of the polymer brusheson the surface of CNCs and as expected, the cationic CNCs would be highly hydrated. Furthermore,DLS analysis indicated no apparent aggregation of CNC particles at low concentrations. The natureof the surface charges on pristine and cationic CNCs was examined by measuring the zeta potentialof the particles in water at 0.25 wt% concentration. Pristine CNCs had a negative zeta potential(-34.8 mV) due to the presence of anionic sulfate half-ester groups. On the other hand, cationic CNCsdisplayed positive zeta potential values in the range of +31.8 to +45.0 mV (Table 2). This furtherconfirmed a successful polymerization reaction and the grafted cationic polymer brushes shielded theanionic sulfate half-ester groups. An increase in zeta potential (becomes more positive) was observedwith an increase in monomer concentration ([monomer/AGU]: 50:3 v/s 60:3, Table 1). For instance,CNC-METAC-1B which had a higher monomer concentration compared to CNC-METAC-1A showeda more positive zeta potential value (+44.9 mV v/s +31.8 mV). The same trend was observed forCNC-METAC-2B (+38.2 mV) compared to CNC-METAC-2A (+32.0 mV). Overall, the cationic natureand colloidal stability of CNC-METAC and CNC-AEM materials are crucial for consistent results inbiological studies.The atomic composition of CNC samples before and after polymer grafting was measured byelemental analysis (Table 3). As expected, a small percentage of sulfur was detected for pristine CNCsdue to the presence of the sulfate half-ester groups. While pristine CNCs displayed the absence ofnitrogen, all the prepared cationic CNCs indicated the appearance of nitrogen deriving from thecationic monomers (METAC or AEM). This further supported the success of the polymerizationreaction. The cationic CNC with a fixed initiator content and increased monomer concentration(CNC-METAC-1B v/s CNC-METAC-1A, Table 1) had a higher nitrogen content (~7.68%).13Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 1603 Figure 2.

Figure 2B–F, Figures S4 and S5 indicated that the rod-like morphology of the cationic CNCswas retained and the samples did not degrade into more simple carbohydrates [32]. Accurate sizemeasurement of the rod-like particles by TEM was difficult as the edges of the grafted CNCs were lessdefined as well as a tendency to aggregate during air-drying or staining [33]. AFM analysis of pristineCNCs depicted a good distribution of the nanorods possessing an average length of 104 ± 68 nmand diameter of 4.0 ± 0.5 nm with a resultant aspect ratio of 26 (Figure 2D). The size of the cationicCNCs was found to be in the range of 112–164 nm in average length and 4.9–5.3 nm in cross-section.Moreover, AFM phase images of the cationic CNCs (Figure 2D,E) showed a halo that was indicativeof the presence of grafted polymer brushes [26]. Aggregation of nanoparticles was observed forCNC-METAC-2B (Figure 2F) as it was prepared with a high monomer concentration (compared toCNC-METAC-2A (Figure 2E)), and hence a high degree of polymerization was expected [34].3.2. Cytotoxicity Studies of Cationic CNCsAssessment of toxicity in cell-based assays is a rapid, simple, and affordable approach to addressthe initial safety of nanomaterials with potential for biomedical application. These cytotoxic assayscan be considered as a crucial part of the characterization of nanomaterials [35]. To evaluate thecytotoxicity of the cationic CNCs, we chose to perform MTT and NR assays using the firmly attachedJ774A.1 and BV2 cell lines because (i) these assays are largely used for screening of toxic andharmless compounds, (ii) quick analysis and low manipulation of attached cells after treatment and(iii) satisfactory reproducibility. In addition to cell lines, we tested the toxicity in a more relevant cellsystem, such as human cells PBMCs since the biological application of these nanomaterials can involvesystemic circulation throughout the body. To assess the CNCs impact on cell viability in PBMCs,which remain loosely attached to the plate when not primed, we chose LIVE/DEAD® assay followedby flow cytometry analysis since it is an easy-to-use and sensitivity assay and PBMCs are not the mostsuitable cell type to access cytotoxicity by MTT or NR using a plate reader. Overall, our results indicatedthat CNCs have none or very low negative impact (<20%) on the cell viability assessed by all threecytotoxicity assays in all the cell types tested. However, results differed among CNCs and some celltypes are more sensitive than others, depending on the assay used. Using MTT assay, which assessescell viability by mainly mitochondria dehydrogenases, our data showed that in BV2 cells, the pristineCNC and CNC-AEM-1 did not decrease cell viability in any tested condition (Figure 3A). However,the METAC-modified CNCs did show a small decrease in cell viability, statistically significant, but notin a dose-response manner (Figure 3B). Using the same assay in J774A.1 cells, all the AEM-(Figure 3C)and METAC-modified CNCs (Figure 3D) did not impact negatively the cell viability in all testedconcentrations. Interestingly, at the lowest concentration of CNC-METAC-1B (10 μg/mL), an increasein the conversion of tetrazolium to formazan was observed (Figure 3D). This effect does not indicatethat there was an increase in cell viability above the control but rather an increase in the mitochondriadehydrogenase activity. This effect is not unknown since we have previously observed similar increaseswith other functionalized CNCs in other cell types, including MCF-7, a breast cancer cell line [23].One reason for such an effect could be attributed to more tetrazolium dye entering into the cells,and therefore being more available to the dehydrogenases. A plausible explanation for potentiallymore dye entering the cells is that engineered nanomaterials, particularly high aspect ratio materials,can cause plasma membrane perturbation among other effects [36].15Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 1603Figure 3.

Representative of 3 independent experiments,in triplicates. * p < 0.01 compared to control, non-treated cells.Data from NR assay indicated that in BV2 cells, CNC-AEM-2 appeared to cause an augmentationof NR dye uptake mainly in the highest concentrations (Figure 4A). A marginal negative effect oncell viability was observed in the cells treated with CNC-METAC-1B at the highest dose, 100 μg/mL(Figure 4B). Similar to what was observed with MTT assay, the J774A.1 cell line appeared to be lesssensitive than BV2 cells. The AEM-modified CNC did not affect J774A.1 cells (Figure 4C) and onlyCNC-METAC-1B had a negative effect on the viability of these cells, although not a dose-responseeffect (Figure 4D). These differences could be attributed to potential physico-chemical changes on thenanomaterials since some nanomaterials might tend to form large agglomerates, sometimes largerthan 100 nm size due to particle interaction with serum proteins [37], which was observed to have asignificant effect on particle dispersion for certain materials. Furthermore, the cell lines used in thisstudy were grown in a different medium, for instance, while J774A.1 cells were cultivated in RPMI,BV2 cells were grown in DMEM. Another aspect to consider is the differences in cellular responses wasthe biological differences among cell lines per se.16Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 1603Figure 4.

After 24 hof treatment, cell viability in BV2 and J774A.1 cell lines was determined spectrophotometrically.(A,C) pristine CNC and AEM modified and (B,D) METAC modified CNCs. Representative of 3independent experiments, in triplicates. * p < 0.01 compared to control, non-treated cells.We also evaluated the cytotoxicity of these modified CNCs using PBMCs and LIVE/DEAD®assay. Corroborating with what was observed with cell lines, the overall cell viability in primary cellsPBMCs was not affected significantly and in a dose-response manner. Despite the variation of thedata, the percentage of ethidium bromide-labeled cells did not change significantly in the presence ofdifferent concentrations of AEM- or METAC-modified CNCs, in comparison to the non-treated cells(Figures 5 and 6, respectively). As expected, H2O2 (positive control) increased the dead cell populationas observed in the significant increases in the percentage of ethidium bromide labeling (Figure 5D,F).Although we observed that CNC-METAC-1B (Figure 6B) and CNC-METAC-2B (Figure 6D) displayeddifferent flow cytometer spectrum from other CNCs, this difference appeared not to be related withan increase in cell death since it neither showed a characteristic peak in the H2O2 intensity range(Figure 5,D) nor a dose-response effect. We also did not observe differences in Calcein-AM stainingbetween treatments and control. The SSC vs. FSC plot of non-stained cells was used for gating cellsand excluding debris (Figure S6). A typical LIVE DEAD® flow cytometer SSC vs. FSC plot of stainingcells (Ethidium bromide and Calcein-AM) treated of 100 μg/mL is displayed in the supplementalmaterials (Figure S7).17Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 1603Figure 5.

ConclusionsIn conclusion, a series of novel cationic CNCs were successfully synthesized via SI-SET-LRP atroom temperature. The cationic CNCs displayed rod-like structures with different sizes and positivesurface charges. The morphological features and structural integrity of the cationic CNCs were retainedas evidenced by both TEM and AFM analyses. In general, the cationic CNCs showed low toxicity andthe slight decreases in cell viability were cell-type dependent and did not indicate any correlationwith physico-chemical characteristics. This initial analysis is crucial for further biological applications,suggesting that these cellulose-based nanomaterials would be good candidates to be investigated asimmunomodulators and further developed as potential vaccine nanoadjuvants.Supplementary Materials: The following are available online at http://www.mdpi.com/2079-4991/10/8/1603/s1:Preparation of CNC-initiators and cationic CNCs, Figure S1: FTIR spectra of pristine CNCs, CNC-BriB-1 andCNC-BriB-2, Table S1: Amounts of reactants and reagents used for the preparation of cationic CNCs, Figure S2:FTIR spectra of cationic CNCs, Figure S3: Intensity-averaged size distribution profiles for pristine CNCs andCNC-METAC-1B in water, Figure S4: TEM images of cationic CNCs, Figure S5: AFM height and phase images ofcationic CNCs, Figure S6: controls and gating for flow cytometry, Figure S7: Typical representative flow cytometrySSC vs. FSC plots.19Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 1603Author Contributions: Conceptualization, R.S. and K.C.; investigation, Y.I., B.T., C.W.S., and A.R., (synthesisand characterization), Y.L. and S.H.

In this study, the effects of the preparation method on the properties ofstarch films were investigated by preparing NC from cationic-modified microcrystalline cellulose(MD-MCC) using three methods: Acid hydrolysis (AH), high-pressure homogenization (HH), andhigh-intensity ultrasonication (US). When MD-MCC was used as the starting material, the yield of NCdramatically increased compared to the NC yield obtained from unmodified MCC and the increasedzeta potential improved its suspension stability in water. The NC prepared by the different methodshad a range of particle sizes and exhibited needle-like structures with high aspect ratios. Fouriertransform infrared (FTIR) spectra indicated that trimethyl quaternary ammonium salt groups wereintroduced to the cellulose backbone during etherification. AH-NC had a much lower maximumdecomposition temperature (Tmax) than HH-NC or US-NC. The starch/HH-NC film exhibited the bestwater vapor barrier properties because the HH-NC particles were well-dispersed in the starch matrix, asdemonstrated by the surface morphology of the film. Our results suggest that cationic NC is a promisingreinforcing agent for the development of starch-based biodegradable food-packaging materials.Keywords: nanocellulose; cationic microcrystalline cellulose; high-intensity ultrasonication; high-pressure homogenization; acid hydrolysis; starch nanocomposite films1. IntroductionCellulose is the most abundant renewable natural resource and thus has attracted the interest ofresearchers around the world [1]. Native cellulose consists of amorphous and crystalline regions; whensubjected to appropriate treatments such as mechanical, chemical, or enzymatic methods; nanocellulose(NC) can be obtained by breaking down amorphous regions [2]. In recent years; NC has become one ofthe most promising nanomaterials and has attracted increasing attention in the field of nanocompositesbecause of its appealing intrinsic properties which include its high specific surface area; high aspectratio; low density; high chemical reactivity; high tensile strength; and high Young’s modulus [3–6].Multiple technologies have been developed to prepare NC from cellulosic materials, includingultrasonication [7], high-pressure homogenization [8], steam explosion treatment [9], high-speedgrinding [10], acid hydrolysis [11], TEMPO (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl radical) oxidation [12],Nanomaterials 2019, 9, 1702; doi:10.3390/nano9121702 www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials23Nanomaterials 2019, 9, 1702and combined treatments [13]. The morphology and properties of NC particles determine theirapplication properties and are affected by preparation methods [14]. Recently, there has been increasinginterest in the production of NC from microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) because MCC has a high cellulosecontent, which is affected by its pectin, hemicellulose, lignin, and other lignocellulosic components [15].The main drawback of acid hydrolysis, ultrasonication, and high-pressure homogenization methodsusing MCC is their low NC yield [16–18]. Several studies have attempted to increase the NC yieldfrom MCC; however, their methods were limited by complicated pretreatment steps, high-energyconsumption, long treatment times, and high water consumption [18–20].Nanocellulose has been widely used as a reinforcing agent for various advanced compositeapplications because of its unique advantages [21], which include improving the mechanical andwater-vapor barrier properties of starch films [22]. However, NC particles tend to agglomerate via vander Waals forces and hydrogen bonding during film preparation because a large number of hydroxylgroups are present on the NC surface, which restricts the advantages they offer. The dispersion of NC instarch matrices and the interfacial adhesion between NC and starch are widely accepted as the criticalfactors determining the reinforcement effect of NC in starch [14]; the advantages offered by NC—i.e.,large aspect ratio, high modulus, and large surface area to interact with the starch matrix—can only befully realized when NC is homogeneously distributed in the starch matrix.Surface modification of NC to improve its dispersion and compatibility with polymer matriceshas been widely studied and different surface modification methods have been reported, such asetherification [23], esterification [24], ionic interaction [25], silylation [26], and oxidation [27]. Most ofthe previous studies modified the NC directly. However, surface modification of NC is complicatedand has limited effectiveness because of the highly aggregated structure of NC [28]. Therefore, it wasdifficult to prepare NC with a modified group. Alkaline solutions are known to swell cellulose samples.Alkali-swelling can disrupt hydrogen bonding between microfibrils in pulp fibers and could facilitatenanofibrillation [29]. This suggests that pre-swelling can be conducive to nanofibrillation of the MCC.This has positive significance for resource conservation and environmental protection. Thus, thepreparation of NC from previously swelling and modified MCC is a new strategy that warrants study.In order to efficiently obtain modified NC with high dispersibility in starch film, a new preparationprocess has been developed. Microcrystalline cellulose was swelling by sodium hydroxide solutionand first modified with 3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl trimethylammonium chloride. Then, cationic NCswere prepared from previously modified MCC by acid hydrolysis, high-pressure homogenization,and high-intensity ultrasonication. The yield, zeta potential, average particle size, dispersion stability,morphology, crystallinity, chemical structure, and thermal stability of the NC particles were studied.Finally, the effects of the NC preparation methods on the physico-chemical properties of starchnanocomposites were investigated.2. Materials and Methods2.1. MaterialsCotton microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) was purchased from Huzhou City Linghu XinwangChemical Co., Ltd. (Huzhou, China), (3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl)trimethylammonium chloride (CHPTA)was obtained from Chengdu Aikeda Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Chengdu, China), and starch waspurchased from Hangzhou Starpro Co., Ltd. (Hangzhou, China).2.2. Cationic Modification of Microcrystalline Cellulose (MCC)Microcrystalline cellulose was soaked in a 10% sodium hydroxide solution with a solid to liquidratio of 1 to 10 (1 g/10 mL) at 25 ◦C for 24 h, whose purpose was to swell cellulose so that CHPTA couldenter the cellulose. Then the MCC suspension was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min and neutralizedwith diluted hydrochloric acid. After centrifugation, the MCC was dried in an oven at 60 ◦C for 48 hand subsequently ground into powder.24Nanomaterials 2019, 9, 1702A 30 g sample of the MCC powder was dispersed in 600 mL of deionized water and 9.87 g sodiumhydroxide was added while stirring at room temperature for 30 min. The cationic etherifying agentwas then gradually added with continuous stirring and the molar ratio of sodium hydroxide to CHPTAwas fixed at 1.2:1. The reaction mixture was stirred for 5 h at 65 ◦C and the resultant suspensionwas centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min to obtain the precipitate. The precipitate was suspended indeionized water to remove CHPTA, then dried and ground into powder. The modified MCC is referredto as MD-MCC.2.3. Preparation of Nanocellulose (NC)For acid hydrolysis, 10 g of the MCC/MD-MCC was dispersed in 100 mL of 60% (v/v) sulfuricacid. Hydrolysis was conducted at 55 ◦C with constant stirring for 1 h, after which the reaction wasstopped by adding cold water (10-fold dilution). The suspension was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for15 min and dialyzed with distilled water for several days until the dialysate became neutral; the neutralsuspension was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min to recover the colloidal suspension. The resultantNC is referred to as AH-NC.For high-pressure homogenization, 1 g of MCC/MD-MCC was added to 100 mL of deionizedwater and homogenized 4 times at 800 bar using a SCIENTZ-150 high pressure homogenizer (NingboXinzhi Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Ningbo, China). The resultant cellulose suspension was centrifuged at10,000 rpm for 5 min to recover the precipitate, which was then suspended in deionized water. Thisprocess was repeated 3 times. The NC colloidal suspension obtained as the supernatant is referred toas HH-NC.For high-intensity ultrasonication, MCC/MD-MCC was soaked in deionized water for 24 h with asolid to liquid ratio of 1:100. The suspension was homogenized using the TJS-3000 ultrasonicator (1750 Wfor 30 min) and subsequently centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min to recover the precipitate, whichwas suspended in deionized water. This process was repeated 3 times. The NC colloidal suspensionobtained as the supernatant is referred to as US-NC.The yield of NC was calculated gravimetrically according to Equation (1):Yield (%) =(Weight of NCWeight of MCC)×100% (1)2.4. Preparation of Starch/NC Composite FilmsStarch/NC composite films were prepared using a solution casting method. A certain amount ofNC (5% w/w of starch) was dispersed in 100 mL of deionized water by ultrasonication at 600 W for5 min; 3 g of starch and 0.9 g of glycerol were subsequently added and the suspension was stirred at85 ◦C for 1 h. The sample solution was poured onto a PTFE glass plate (24 cm × 12 cm), dried at 60 ◦Cfor 6 h, and then peeled off and kept at 23 ◦C and 53% relative humidity for at least 7 d prior to testing.2.5. Characterization of MCC and NC2.5.1. Particle Size and Zeta PotentialThe average particle size and zeta potential of the NC in aqueous suspensions were determinedusing a Nanobrook ZetaPlus Potential Analyzer (Brookhaven Instruments Corporation, Holtsville, NY,USA) under the following conditions: 1.3328 water refractive index, 90◦ angle, and 25 ◦C.2.5.2. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)The morphology of the MCC and MD-MCC were analyzed by scanning electron microscope(QUANTA FEG 250, FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA) at a voltage of 5.0 kV. The specimens were placed on abronze stub and sputter-coated with gold before testing.25Nanomaterials 2019, 9, 1702The morphological characteristics of NC were studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM)with a TECNAI 20 U-TWIN microscope (PHIA, Eindhoven, Netherlands) using an acceleration voltageof 100 kV. The prepared suspension was spotted on to a carbon coated copper grid. The grid was driedbefore TEM analysis. The length and diameter of NC were measured using image analysis (NanoMeasure software) at least 100 randomly selected NC fibrils in certain TEM images.2.5.3. X-ray Diffraction (XRD)X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the NC samples were determined with a D8 X-ray diffractometer(Bruker-AXS, Karlsruhe, Germany) equipped with a copper target (λ = 0.15406 nm) at 30 mA and40 kV. Data were recorded in the range (2θ) of 5–40◦ at a scan rate of 0.02◦·s–1. The crystallinity indexwas calculated with Equation (2):CrI =I200 − IamI200(2)where CrI is the crystallinity index, I200 is the maximum intensity of the diffraction from the 200 plane,and Iam is the intensity of particles scattered by the amorphous part of the sample.2.5.4. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) SpectroscopyThe fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of MCC, MD-MCC and NC were recorded using aNicolet iS5 spectrometer with iD5 ATR sampling accessory (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA,USA). All spectra were collected from an accumulation of 32 scans at wavelengths ranging between4000 and 600 cm−1.2.5.5. Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA)Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed to analyze the thermal properties of NCsamples using a TA-60 thermogravimetric analyzer (SHIMADZU, Japan) under nitrogen flow of50 mL/min. Heating temperature ranged from 25 ◦C to 500 ◦C at a heating rate of 10 ◦C·min–1.2.6. Characterization of Starch/NC Composite Films2.6.1. Mechanical PropertiesTensile strength (TS, MPa), elongation at break (EAB, %) and elastic modulus (EM, GPa) of thefilms were measured with an XLW auto tensile tester (Labthink Instruments Co. Ltd., Jinan, China)according to ASTM (American Society of Testing Materials) D882-12 (2012). The samples were cut intostrips (dimensions, 150 mm × 15 mm). The initial distance between the grips was 100 mm and the testspeed was set at 100 mm/min. Each test was repeated at least six times.2.6.2. Water Vapor Permeability (WVP)Water vapor permeability (WVP) was measured according to ASTM E96/E96M-16 (2016) using aPERME™W3/030 automatic water vapor permeability tester (Labthink Instruments Co., Ltd., Jinan,China). Films were cut into round specimens (80 mm in diameter) with a special sampler. The test wasperformed at 38.0 ◦C and 90% RH (relative humidity) with a preheating time of 4 h and a weighinginterval of 120 min. The WVP of each sample was obtained from the average of three measurements.2.6.3. Morphology of Starch Nanocomposite FilmsThe morphology of starch composite films was analyzed by scanning electron microscope(QUANTA FEG 250, FEI, Hillsborough, OR, USA) at a voltage of 5.0 kV. The specimens were placed ona bronze stub and sputter-coated with gold before testing.26Nanomaterials 2019, 9, 17022.7. Statistical AnalysisStatistical differences between the properties of MCC, MD-MCC, NC, and starch films weredetermined by analysis of variance (ANOVA) via SPSS 21 (IBM Co., Armonk, NY, USA). Comparisonsof mean values were performed using Duncan’s multiple range tests (p < 0.05).3. Results and Discussion3.1. Effect of Preparation Method on the Yield of NC Prepared from MCC and Modified MicrocrystallineCellulose (MD-MCC)Low NC yield is a limiting factor in industrial production and commercial applications. The yieldsof NC prepared from MCC and MD-MCC acid hydrolysis, high-pressure homogenization, andhigh-intensity ultrasonication are shown in Table 1. The yield of AH-NC prepared from MD-MCCwas 30.63% which increased by 48.1%, compared with that prepared from MCC. Moreover, the yieldsof HH-NC and US-NC prepared from MCC were only 2.04% and 3.57%, respectively, whereas theyields from MD-MCC were 33.08% and 14.18%; these correspond to increases of approximately16.2 and 3.97 times, respectively. These results demonstrate that cationic etherification of MCCcould significantly increase the NC yield of different preparation methods, especially high-pressurehomogenization and high-intensity ultrasonication. The NC yields of AH-NC and HH-NC preparedfrom MD-MCC are comparable to other reports of NC obtained under the similar conditions [30,31],and it can be increased with the optimization of the treatment conditions; however, there is minimalinformation on the effect of separate ultrasound processing on NC yield as ultrasonication has primarilybeen used as an auxiliary processing method.Table 1. Effect of preparation method on the yield, zeta potential, and average particle size of NCprepared from MCC and MD-MCC.NC SamplesRaw MaterialsMCC MD-MCCYield (%)AH-NC 20.68 ± 0.04 30.63 ± 0.08HH-NC 2.04 ± 0.14 33.08 ± 0.34US-NC 3.57 ± 0.21 14.18 ± 0.10Zeta potential (mV)AH-NC –5.82 ± 0.09 –5.17 ± 1.18HH-NC –0.71 ± 1.02 15.66 ± 0.44US-NC –1.41 ± 0.85 16.01 ± 0.66Average particle size(nm)AH-NC 69.5 ± 0.3 69.0 ± 0.3HH-NC 253.3 ± 0.4 161.4 ± 1.4US-NC 347.9 ± 5.6 255.0 ± 2.9Natural cellulose is insoluble and tends to agglomerate in water as it forms an extensive networkof intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonds, which can clog valves in homogenizers. Thus,the HH yield of NC prepared from MCC is typically low [32]. During the preparation of US-NC,ultrasonication affected the surface to the inner amorphous regions of MCC and caused MCC tobreak into submicron fragments instead of directly forming NC. However, the small size of the MCCfragments impeded the ultrasonication process and resulted in the low NC yield [12,18]. Conversely,acid molecules can rapidly penetrate into the inner amorphous regions of the cellulose fibrils wherethey disintegrate amorphous regions, reduce the size of the cellulose fibers, and ultimately releasecellulose nanofibrils [33]; thus, AH-NC had a higher yield than HH-NC or US-NC. Considering theseprocesses, cationic modification of MCC can substantially affect NC preparation by acid hydrolysis,high-pressure homogenization, and high-intensity ultrasonication methods.27Nanomaterials 2019, 9, 17023.2. Effect of Preparation Method on the Suspension Stability of NC Prepared from MCC and MD-MCCThe suspension states of NC prepared from MCC and MD-MCC by acid hydrolysis, high-pressurehomogenization, and high-intensity ultrasonication are shown in Figure 1. All NC samples werewell-dispersed in water and their suspensions were stable and uniform without any stratification whenfresh. After 3 days at 20 ◦C, flocculation and precipitation occurred in the HH-NC and US-NC samplesprepared from MCC whereas the other NC samples remained homogeneous, which indicates that theNC particles prepared by MD-MCC were relatively stable in water.Figure 1. The suspension stability of NC prepared from MCC (AH-1, HH-1, US-1) and MD-MCC(AH-2, HH-2, US-2) t = 0 day and t = 3 days.Net charge is a critical characteristic that affects the stability of NC particles. In general, higherabsolute values of zeta potential correspond to better dispersion and stability [2]. The results from thisstudy reveal that the introduction of trimethyl quaternary ammonium groups by cationic modificationof MCC (confirmed by the FTIR results) helped to increase the NC zeta potential and further improvedthe stability and dispersion of the NC particles. Based on the measured yield and application properties,the NC samples prepared from MD-MCC were selected for further analysis.3.3. NC MorphologyThe SEM micrographs of MCC and MD-MCC shown in Figure 2A reveal that MCC particles hadirregular shapes with different dimensions and MD-MCC particles were swollen and porous with arough surface. Moreover, cationic modification damaged MCC particles and eroded their surface suchthat the outer layer of the fibers was disrupted and cracked along the inner structure, exposing thefibril strand. These changes to the MCC granular structures facilitated the substantial increase in NCyield as discussed above.Figure 2. (A) Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs of (a) MCC and (b) MD-MCC; (B)transmission electron microscopy (TEM) micrographs of (c) AH-NC, (d) HH-NC, and (e) US-NC.The TEM micrographs of AH-NC, HH-NC, and US-NC shown in Figure 2B illustrate their distinctivemorphologies and dispersion states. Small bundles of needle-like cellulose fibers with nanoscale diameters28Nanomaterials 2019, 9, 1702were observed for AH-NC and branches of smaller bundles or partly individualized nanofibers wereattached to the aggregates as well (arrows in Figure 2B(c)). The formation of such aggregates significantlyreduced the surface area of the AH-NC particles and thus hindered their reinforcing ability. Conversely,the HH-NC and US-NC nanofibers were well-dispersed and more individualized.The NC dispersion state was directly associated with the surface interactions between adjacentNC particles because different surface interactions exist in aqueous solution, including attraction forces(e.g., hydrogen bonding) and repulsion forces (e.g., electrostatic repulsion). Attraction and repulsionforces are expected to compete with each other and thus determine the distinctive dispersion state ofaqueous NC from different preparation methods. Therefore, the uniform dispersion of HH-NC andUS-NC in aqueous solution was ascribed to profound repulsion forces whereas the AH-NC aggregateswere attributed to predominant attraction forces. These theories were confirmed by the zeta potentialvalues shown in Table 1. As expected, the order of absolute zeta potential values of NC preparedfrom MD-MCC was AH-NC < HH-NC < US-NC, which corresponds to the observed dispersion states.Because of the sulfate anions present during acid hydrolysis, the zeta potential value of AH-NC was notsubstantially changed. The dispersion states also indicate that hydrogen bonding between nanofiberswas lower for HH-NC and US-NC.3.4. Length-Frequency and Diameter-Frequency HistogramsLength-frequency and diameter-frequency histograms (Figure 3) were prepared using the TEMdata. Aggregation and overlapping nanofibers make it difficult to accurately measure dimensions;thus, only individual nanofibers with clearly identifiable ends were measured. The AH-NC exhibited awide distribution of lengths whereas the diameter distribution had a narrower range of 2 to 8 nm withthe maximum at 4.5 nm. The length distributions of HH-NC and US-NC were 25 to 275 nm and 75 to350 nm, respectively. The diameter distributions of HH-NC and US-NC were 3 to 15 nm and 4 to 10nm, respectively. The length and diameter distributions of HH-NC and US-NC were wider than thoseof AH-NC. Therefore, AH-NC had the smallest particles of the three preparation methods (Table 1).Figure 3. Length-frequency and diameter-frequency histograms of (a) AH-NC, (b) HH-NC, and(c) US-NC.These results are comparable to those of other studies [2,34,35]. The average aspect ratios (L/D) ofHH-NC and US-NC were 21.20 and 23.20, respectively, which were lower than that of AH-NC (36.73).According to a previous report [36], the reinforcing effect of NC is expected to improve as the aspectratio increases, which may further improve the mechanical properties of biocomposites. The lengthand diameter of NC prepared from various sources has been reported: 100–300 nm length and 3–5 nm29Nanomaterials 2019, 9, 1702diameter from wood [37], 171.6 nm length and 14.6 nm diameter from cotton [38], 1160 nm length and16 nm diameter from tunicate [39], and 100–1000 nm length and 10–50 nm diameter from bacterialcellulose [40].The morphology and dimensions of NC depended on the preparation method and each methodresulted in distinct features. Acid hydrolysis, a well-known method for preparing NC, results in a largeraspect ratio than the homogenization and ultrasonication methods. These mechanical process canbreak hydrogen bonds and disintegrate microfibers into nanofibrils, which form needle-like cellulosecrystallites and consequently reduce the aspect ratio of NC.3.5. XRD Analysis of MCC and NCThe effects of mechanical and chemical treatments on the crystalline structure of the cellulosesamples were further characterized by XRD as shown in Figure 4. Both MCC and MD-MCC exhibitedcharacteristic crystalline peaks near 2θ = 15.1◦, 16.2◦, 21.0◦, 22.6◦, and 34.5◦; these peaks correspond tothe (1−10), (110), (012), (200), and (004) crystallographic planes, respectively, and are characteristic ofthe cellulose I structure [41,42]. The AH-NC had the same crystalline peaks as MCC and MD-MCCexcept that the diffraction peak at 2θ = 34.5◦ was broader and flatter, and this peak disappeared afterhigh-pressure homogenization and high-intensity ultrasonication. Generally, NC obtained via thethree different preparation methods exhibited the characteristic cellulose I peaks, which indicates thatacid hydrolysis, high-pressure homogenization, and high-intensity ultrasonication do not affect themain crystalline properties of cellulose.Figure 4. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of MCC, MD-MCC, AH-NC, HH-NC, and US-NC.The crystallinity of NC is an important parameter as it determines its reinforcing capability andmechanical strength in composite films [43]. Highly crystalline fibers are expected to be more effectiveat providing reinforcement for composite materials because of their increased stiffness and rigidity,which result in a higher Young’s modulus. However, the crystallinity of MD-MCC and the prepared NCeach decreased to a different extent relative to MCC (Table 2). The peak at 22.6◦ was less sharp for thealkali-treated MCC, which suggests that alkali swelling might destroy part of the crystalline structure [44].Cationic modification of MCC disrupted both intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bondingand facilitated the formation of amorphous regions [6]. The results of this study indicate that the NCpreparation methods were non-selective as they damaged both amorphous and crystalline cellulose;therefore, the crystallinity of NC decreased [2,7,45]. As shown in Table 2, the crystallinity of AH-NC(67.6%) was the highest of the three NC, which implies that the crystalline regions of MD-MCC weremore resistant to the acid treatment than the mechanical treatments. Moreover, the crystallinity ofUS-NC (62.8%) was slightly higher than that of HH-NC (61.8%), which suggests that high-intensityultrasonication was less aggressive than high-pressure homogenization.30Nanomaterials 2019, 9, 1702Table 2.

Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy Analysis of MCC and NCFourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to understand the changes in the chemicalstructures of the MCC and NC (Figure 5). Two main absorption regions, 2800–3600 cm−1 and750–1750 cm−1, were present in the spectra. The broad band centered at approximately 3332 cm−1corresponds to O-H stretching of cellulose in the fiber [46]. The intensity of the O-H peak in theMD-MCC spectrum was considerably less than that of the MCC spectrum, which indicates that thenumber of hydroxyl groups in the MD-MCC was reduced by the etherification reaction [6]. The peaksnear 2900 cm−1 are attributed to the C-H stretching vibration of cellulose and the peaks at 1644 cm−1have been assigned to water absorption because of the strong cellulose-water interaction [47]. Inaddition to the characteristic peaks of the cellulose backbone, there was a small peak near 1479 cm−1 inthe MD-MCC and NC spectra. This peak was not present in the MCC spectrum and thus was assignedto the trimethyl quaternary ammonium groups, which implies that trimethyl quaternary ammoniumgroups were successfully added on to cellulose chains even though the degree of substitution was low.Figure 5. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of MCC, MD-MCC, AH-NC, HH-NC, and US-NC.The changes to the crystal structure of cellulose resulted in the intensity reduction of partial FTIRpeaks attributed to the crystalline domains of cellulose [1]. The peak at 1427 cm−1 corresponds to theCH2 bending vibration of crystalline cellulose and the NC spectra exhibit reduced intensity of thiscrystalline band compared to those of the MCC. The reduced intensity of this peak also supports thedecreased crystallinity of NC after acid hydrolysis, high-pressure homogenization, and high-intensityultrasonication as demonstrated by the XRD results. The reduced crystallinity of NC compared toMCC implies that there is less intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonding in NC, whichmight increase the dispersion of NC in water [1]. The peak at 1030 cm−1 is related to C-O stretching ofthe pyranose ring skeleton [48]. The peak at 890 cm−1 is corresponds to β-glycosidic linkages betweenthe glucose units of cellulose. Based on the above analysis, there was not a significant differencebetween the MCC and NC spectra, which indicates that neither the mechanical nor chemical treatmentschanged the main chemical structure of the fibers. This result agrees with the XRD analysis.31Nanomaterials 2019, 9, 17023.7. Thermal Stability AnalysisThe thermal stability of each of MCC, MD-MCC, AH-NC, HH-NC, and US-NC was investigatedby TGA, as shown in Figure 6. The onset of thermal decomposition temperature (Ton) corresponds tothe beginning of degradation and the maximum decomposition temperature (Tmax) corresponds tothe temperature of the maximum rate of degradation. The Ton, Tmax, mass loss at Tmax, and the charresiduals at 500 ◦C are given in Table 2. Generally, the thermal degradation of MCC and NC occurred intwo steps, as shown in Figure 6. The initial mass loss, which was caused by the evaporation of absorbedwater, was observed below 120 ◦C and was slightly different for the different cellulose samples.Figure 6. (a) Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and (b) derivative thermogravimetry (DTG) curves ofMCC, MD-MCC, AH-NC, HH-NC, and US-NC.As shown in Table 2, the Ton of each NC was less than that of MCC, which indicates that NC hasdecreased thermal stability. This decreased thermal stability might be attributed to the large number ofcellulose chain segments that were damaged during the preparation of NC and formed low molecularchain segments and weak points in the cellulose chain on the surface of NC. At elevated temperatures,these low molecular chain segments and defects absorbed heat and thus began to degrade first, whichresulted in the reduced thermal stability of NC. Furthermore, the nanoscale lateral dimensions of NCmean that NC has a higher surface to volume ratio than MCC and thus is heated more efficiently,which also decreases thermal stability [49]. Compared with AH-NC and US-NC, the lower thermalstability of HH-NC could be due to the increased damage to the crystalline region of cellulose duringthe high-pressure homogenization process as indicated by the XRD results [50].The main thermal degradation stages of MCC, MD-MCC, AH-NC, HH-NC, and US-NC occurredin the range of 250–430 ◦C, 200–430 ◦C, 210–360 ◦C, 240–405 ◦C, and 250–405 ◦C, respectively; thisdegradation was mainly due to the thermal decomposition of the crystalline cellulose chains. Themass losses caused by the thermal decomposition of AH-NC, HH-NC, and US-NC at Tmax were 50.8%,52.9%, and 50.4%, respectively, and the corresponding Tmax were 298 ◦C, 349 ◦C, and 365 ◦C. The masslosses of each type of NC were very similar but the corresponding Tmax varied significantly, whichindicates that acid hydrolysis, high-pressure homogenization, and high-intensity ultrasonication haddifferent effects on the thermal stability of NC. The sulfate groups that were added to the cellulosechains during acid hydrolysis could facilitate the thermal degradation of cellulose [51], which wouldexplain why the Tmax of AH-NC was less than those of HH-NC and US-NC. Moreover, this resultwas consistent with the previous study by Wang et al. [36]. Above 450 ◦C, the thermal decompositiontemperature of each cellulose sample leveled off and a slow thermal degradation profile was obtained.This continued degradation could be attributed to the carbonization of polysaccharide chains causedby the cleavage of C-C and C-H bonds.The mass of char residue in AH-NC, HH-NC, and US-NC at 500 ◦C was 20.6%, 14.2%, and 8.5%,respectively, which are all greater than that of MCC (7.6%). The high char residue of AH-NC hasbeen ascribed to the direct solid-to-gas phase transitions of decarboxylation catalyzed by the sulfategroups on the surface of AH-NC [52]. The high char yield of HH-NC might be due to its relatively32Nanomaterials 2019, 9, 1702high dehydration at low temperatures, which carbonized cellulose as confirmed by its relatively lowdegradation temperature. The low char residue yield of US-NC might be ascribed to its low crystallinecontent [2].3.8. Mechanical PropertiesThe tensile strength (TS), elongation at break (EAB), and elastic modulus (EM) of starch films withand without the addition of 5% NC are shown in Table 3. TS is the measurement of maximum strengthof a film against applied tensile stress, EAB represents the ability of a film to stretch, and EM indicatesthe rigidity of a film. The TS of the pure starch film was 6.32 MPa. The TS of the starch/NC filmswas considerably greater than that of the pure starch film. The TSs of the starch nanocomposite filmsprepared from AH-NC, HH-NC, and US-NC were 9.35 MPa, 11.74 MPa, and 10.75 MPa, respectively,which correspond to 1.47, 1.85, and 1.70 times the TS of pure starch film. Li et al. [22] reported that NCcan improve the tensile strength of starch films when NC is uniformly distributed in the starch matrix.The strong adhesion at the starch/NC interface and the creation of a rigid NC percolating networkwithin the starch matrix facilitate efficient stress transfer from the soft starch matrix to the rigid NCand thus improve the strength of the starch nanocomposite [53]. Moreover, cationic modification is ahydrophilic modification that introduces hydrophilic quaternary ammonium salt groups; therefore, thecationic NC has excellent compatibility and strong interactions with starch because hydrogen bondscan form between them, which greatly increases the TS of the nanocomposite films.Table 3. Mechanical properties and water vapor permeability of starch/NC composite films.Samples TS (MPa) * EAB (%) * EM (MPa) *WVP(10−12 g·cm·cm−2·s−1·Pa−1) *starch 6.32 ± 0.86d 25.33 ± 0.85a 369.51 ± 13.67c 1.65 ± 0.12astarch/AH-NC 9.35 ± 0.90c 20.1 ± 0.61b 492.69 ± 10.37b 1.42 ± 0.06bstarch/HH-NC 11.74 ± 0.52a 18.8 ± 0.83b 573.08 ± 13.24a 1.28 ± 0.04bstarch/US-NC 10.75 ± 0.79b 19.6 ± 0.76b 513.24 ± 24.25b 1.36 ± 0.88b* Different lowercase letters in the same column indicate a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05).The reinforcing effect of NC on the starch films is also different for the different preparationmethods. This is potentially due to the different aspect ratios of the three types of NC, which couldaffect the dispersion of NC in the starch matrix [6]. Since the AH-NC has the highest aspect ratio,hydrogen bonding might prevent it from being uniformly dispersed throughout the starch matrix [28].Conversely, HH-NC has a low aspect ratio and thus is expected to be well-dispersed in the starch film.This conjecture was verified using the SEM results of the films, which are discussed later in this section.The effects of preparation method of NC on the EAB of starch/NC composite films were shown inTable 3. As expected, the incorporation of NC into the starch matrix substantially decreased the EABand the results were in agreement with previous studies [54,55]. The decrease in EAB is attributed tothe geometry and rigid nature of NC as well as the formation of a stiffNC network linked by hydrogenbonds and entanglements. Moreover, the addition of NC could hinder the plasticizing efficacy ofglycerol and decrease the mobility of starch chains, which would result in brittle nanocompositefilms [56,57]. Effects similar to those observed for NC have been reported for other biopolymers, suchas whey protein isolate and agar [42,58]. Finally, EM, which indicates the rigidity of a film, increasedsignificantly (p < 0.05) when 5% NC was added to the starch film.3.9. Water Vapor Barrier PropertiesThe water vapor permeability (WVP) of a film is one of the most important properties for foodpackaging applications. Because of its hydrophilic nature, starch-based films usually have high WVPand thus poor water vapor barrier properties, which significantly restricts its application in foodpackaging. As shown in Table 3, the water vapor barrier properties of pure starch films could be33Nanomaterials 2019, 9, 1702improved by the incorporation of NC. The WVP of the pure starch film, 1.65× 10−12 g·cm·cm−2·s−1·Pa−1,decreased by approximately 14%, 22%, and 18% (p < 0.05) when 5% of AH-NC, HH-NC, and US-NCwas incorporated into the starch matrix, respectively. This decrease in WVP as the result of theincorporation of NC agrees with previous reports [22,59].The NC in the starch nanocomposite films functions as an impermeable barrier against WVPbecause strong hydrogen bonding interactions reduce the diffusion coefficient of the films by increasingthe diffusion path for water vapor through the film [42]. Unexpectedly, the lower the aspect ratio ofthe NC in the starch matrix, the lower the WVP of the resultant starch nanocomposite films. This resultmight be ascribed to the agglomeration of high aspect ratio NC in the starch matrix, which createsdiffusion pathways for water vapor transport within the film and thus facilitates WVP. Therefore, theuniform distribution of NC in the starch matrix played a more significant role than high aspect ratio inimproving the water vapor barrier properties of starch nanocomposite films.3.10. Surface MorphologyThe surface morphologies of pure starch film and starch nanocomposite films with 5% NC areshown in Figure 7 at 10,000× magnification. The surface of the pure starch film was smooth withhomogeneous morphology and compact structure because of the plasticization effect of glycerol [60].Compared to the pure starch film, the incorporation of AH-NC increased the surface roughness, whichis attributed to the agglomeration of AH-NC in the starch matrix [22]; however, it was difficult toobserve the individual fibers in the film because of the small size and bundle structure of AH-NC in thestarch matrix. Well-dispersed NC particles were observed in the starch/HH-NC and starch/US-NC films;this suggests that there was strong interfacial adhesion or good compatibility between the HH-NCor US-NC and the starch matrix, which could be attributed to the size and zeta potential of the NC,the chemical similarities of starch and NC, and hydrogen bonding between the two components [22].Similar results have been reported for starch nanocomposite films containing pineapple leaf cellulosenanofibers [61]. The homogeneous distribution of NC in starch films could greatly improve theirtensile strength and water vapor barrier properties.Figure 7. Surface morphology of (a) pure starch, (b) starch/AH-NC, (c) starch/HH-NC, and (d)starch/US-NC films.4. ConclusionsHigh yields of NC with different aspect ratios were obtained efficiently from cationic MD-MCCby acid hydrolysis, high-pressure homogenization, and high-intensity ultrasonication and the effectsof AH-NC, HH-NC, and US-NC on the fundamental properties of starch films were compared.The cationic modification of NC was confirmed by FTIR analysis. Both HH-NC and US-NC preparedfrom MD-MCC were stable suspensions because of their higher zeta potential compared to NC samples34Nanomaterials 2019, 9, 1702prepared from MCC. The AH-NC prepared from MD-MCC tended to aggregate because of the presenceof sulfate groups and, thus, lack of surface charge. The XRD analysis revealed that the crystallinity ofNC decreased for all preparation methods whereas the main chemical structure of fibers remainedunchanged. The thermostability of the three types of NC decreased relative to that of MCC. The HH-NCexhibited the best dispersion in the starch matrix and demonstrated the best enhancement to the watervapor barrier properties of starch films. Cationic modification of MCC will be a promising strategyto improve the yields and dispersion of NC and ultimately enhance the properties of starch films.The starch/NC nanocomposite films, which are completely biodegradable and biocompatible, haveimmense potential for food-packaging applications.Author Contributions: L.H. conceived, designed, and performed the experiments; L.H. and W.W. analyzedthe data and wrote original draft; R.Z., H.D. and J.L. wrote review and edited the original draft; L.K. and H.H.contributed reagents/materials/analysis tools; H.H. managed the project and provided financial support.Funding: This work was supported by Great Innovation Program of Agricultural Application Technology inShandong province, the Key Research and Development Program of Shandong province (2018GNC113004,2019GNC106035), Natural Science Foundation of Shandong province (ZR2017BC018), the Foundation (No.KF201808) of State Key Laboratory of Biobased Material and Green Papermaking in Qilu University of Technology(Shandong Academy of Sciences), and Funds of Shandong “Double Tops” Program.Conflicts of Interest: The authors declare no conflict of interest.References1.

Natural rubber latex (NRL) is one of themajor alternative sustainable rubber sources since it is derived from the plant ‘Hevea brasiliensis’.Our study focuses on integrating sustainably processed carboxycellulose nanofibers from untreatedjute biomass into NRL to enhance the mechanical strength of the material for various applications.The carboxycellulose nanofibers (NOCNF) having carboxyl content of 0.94 mmol/g was prepared andintegrated into its nonionic form (–COONa) for its higher dispersion in water to increase the interfacialinteraction between NRL and NOCNF. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic forcemicroscopy (AFM) analyses of NOCNF showed the average dimensions of nanofibers were length(L) = 524 ± 203 nm, diameter (D) 7 ± 2 nm and thickness 2.9 nm. Furthermore, fourier transforminfra-red spectrometry (FTIR) analysis of NOCNF depicted the presence of carboxyl group. However,the dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurement of NRL demonstrated an effective diameter in therange of 643 nm with polydispersity of 0.005. Tensile mechanical strengths were tested to observethe enhancement effects at various concentrations of NOCNF in the NRL. Mechanical propertiesof NRL/NOCNF films were determined by tensile testing, where the results showed an increasingtrend of enhancement. With the increasing NOCNF concentration, the film modulus was found toincrease quite substantially, but the elongation-to-break ratio decreased drastically. The presence ofNOCNF changed the NRL film from elastic to brittle. However, at the NOCNF overlap concentration(0.2 wt. %), the film modulus seemed to be the highest.Keywords: natural rubber latex; NOCNF; jute fibers; nitro-oxidation1. IntroductionSynthetic and natural rubber are a staple commodity for numerous industrial applications [1–6].The International Rubber Study Group (IRSG) [7] reported that the U.S. consumed 2.7 million metrictons of rubber ranging from automotive parts to sealants in 2013. These products consist of mostlysynthetic rubber derived from petroleum sources and natural rubber derived from Hevea trees(Hevea brasiliensis). The use of petroleum-derived synthetic rubber causes several concerns [8,9].The reliance on nonrenewable resources causes a dependent and unstable price for synthetic rubbercosts. Synthetic rubber production also requires a higher energy consumption and is environmentallyNanomaterials 2020, 10, 706; doi:10.3390/nano10040706 www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials39Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 706intensive when compared to using natural rubber [8]. Natural rubber in its unprocessed or raw formhas low strength and that limit their applications. The strength of the natural rubber latex is improvedmostly by the vulcanization process, where the long chains of rubber molecule are cross-linked throughthe chemical process which ultimately transform the natural rubber latex into a strong elastic product(natural rubber) with reversible deformability, good mechanical strength, excellent dynamic propertiesand fatigue resistance [10]. The mechanical properties of natural rubber latex can be improved byaddition of varying types of reinforcing fillers.Nanocellulose is a most abundant, inexpensive and renewable nanomaterial that has potentialin many different applications including pharmaceuticals, food, energy storage, water purification,biomedical, 3D printing, anti-bacterial, carbon nanotubes stabilizer, electronics and tissue engineering.Owing to its exceptional mechanical properties, nontoxicity, biodegradability and tunable chemistryof surface hydroxyl groups, nanocellulose has garnered tremendous levels of attention over the pastdecades [11–13]. There are many methods reported for preparation of nanocellulose from variousbiomass sources, for example, carboxymethylation, acid hydrolysis to produce cellulose nanocrystals,2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxyl (TEMPO) oxidation, nitro-oxidation etc.A potential reinforcing agent for the latex rubbers is the derivatives of natural cellulosepolymers [14–19]. These polymers are called carboxycellulose and have been widely used for biomedicalapplications such as surgical sutures [20–22]. Recent developments of carboxycellulose in the nanoscalehave further expanded their uses in making strengthened nanocomposite materials [23–25]. Sincecarboxycellulose nanofibers is derived from cellulose microfibril building blocks, it is readily able tobe extracted from a variety of biomass materials [26,27]. Some of these biomass materials includejute, spinifex, agave and agricultural wastes [28]. Our study primarily focuses on jute-derivedcarboxycellulose nanofibers extracted using the recently developed nitro-oxidation method [28–32].The nitro-oxidation method is found to be a simple, cost-effective process to extract the carboxycellulosenanofibers from any type of raw biomass that does not require any pretreatment steps. However, theother methods—TEMPO oxidation and carboxymethylation processes—are fully efficient in extractingthe carboxycellulose nanofibers from delignified pulp, which requires prior treatment of raw biomass.Nitro-oxidation produces carboxycellulose nanofibers with residual lignin and hemicellulose impurities;however, it requires less chemicals, processing time and steps for their extraction. Additionally,the unused effluent of the reaction has potential to be converted into nitrogen-rich plant fertilizer.The nitro-oxidation method involves the reaction of nitric acid with sodium nitrite to create nitroxoniumions (NO+) which attacks the hydroxyl group on cellulose to produce a nitrite ester (R–CH2–O–NO).The nitrite ester then decomposes and generates nitroxyl (HNO) and aldehyde groups which is furtheroxidized into carboxyl (COOH) groups. This oxidation cycle continues at the presence of excess HNOand HNO2 to create the saturated carboxyl groups which provide the function sites for further chemicalreaction. Since this is a recently developed method [28,31,33–35], there are also interests in applyingthese carboxycellulose nanofibers materials for further testing.The primary focus of this study is to integrate this low-cost nitro-oxidized carboxycellulosenanofibers (NOCNF) into natural rubber latex sources to observe the enhancement effect of the samplesat various concentrations. Since latex are primarily composed of cis 1,4 polyisoprene emulsions inwater [36], we chose the carboxylate functional group (–COO−) to induce a high dispersity duringthe integration stage. The carboxylate functional group is hydrophilic which along with dispersity,could allow for better interfacial interactions between the fibers and the isoprene molecules. Otherlatex enhancement studies also indicate the use of a hydrophilic carboxycellulose nanofibers state to beeffective for making enhanced nanocomposites with enhanced tensile modulus [23].40Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 7062. Methodologies2.1. MaterialsUntreated jute fibers were provided by Toptrans Bangladesh Ltd. (Dhaka, Bangladesh). Fiberswere cut to 3–5 cm in length and further grinded by an IKA MF 10 basic grinder at 1000 rpm (IKA WorksInc., Wilmington, NC, USA). Analytical-grade nitric acid (ACS reagent 60%) and sodium nitrite (ACSreagent ≥ 97%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Allentown, PA, USA); sodium bicarbonate waspurchased from Fischer Scientific (Fairlawn, NJ, United States). Processed polygen liquid latex (NRL)nonvulcanized with 60% concentration was obtained from UK suppliers (ReAgent, Runcorn, UK).2.2. Experimental Method2.2.1. Preparation of Carboxycellulose Nanofibers (NOCNF)Fifteen grams of untreated grinded jute fibers were placed in a 3 L three-neck, round-bottom flaskwith 210 mL of 60 % nitric acid. Fibers in the flask were allowed to completely soak before adding14.4 g of sodium nitrite. The addition of sodium nitrite forms red gas inside the flask due to generationof NO2 gas. Hence, the mouths of the round bottom flask were sealed with stoppers sealed withparafilm. The reaction was performed at 40 ◦C for 16 h and was then quenched by adding 1 L distilled(DI) water. The supernatant liquid was discarded to remove excess acid and decantation with 70%ethanol and DI water in the ratio of 80:20 was performed 4–5 times until the suspended fibers stoppedsettling down. The fibers suspension was then transferred to a dialysis bag (Spectral/Por, molecularweight cut-off (MWCO): 6–8 kDA) and equilibrated until the conductivity of the water reached below5 μS. The fibers were then treated with 8% sodium bicarbonate up to pH 7.5, to transform the initiallygenerated carboxyl group (COOH) to carboxylate groups (COO−). To remove the excess bicarbonatefrom the fibers, the suspension was again dialyzed using the dialysis bag until the conductivity of thewater reached below 5 μS. The 0.2 wt. % of fibers suspension then passed through homogenizer (GEANiro Soavi Panda Plus Bench top homogenizer, Columbia, MD, USA), at 250 bar for one cycle.2.2.2. Nanocomposite PreparationA 50 mL closed glass vial was used to integrate NRL and NOCNF. Ten milliliters of 60% solid NRLwas measured for each 0–0.4 wt. % sample. A 0.26 wt. % NOCNF suspension with different volumewas added into NRL solution to prepare the solution containing different (0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 wt. %) ofNOCNF. The solutions were set to stir for 16 h followed by 1 h of sonication. Afterwards the preparedsolution was casted evenly on a petri dish and degassed to prevent bubbles forming.2.2.3. Characterization of Carboxycellulose Nanofibers (NOCNF)Fourier Transform Infra-Red Spectrometry (FTIR)The FTIR curve was measured with a PerkinElmer Spectrum One instrument (product model,city, country) with the transmission mode set between 450 and 4000 cm−1. Three scans were taken persample with a resolution of 4 cm−1.Conductometric Titration MethodThe carboxylate (–COO−) group in NOCNF was determined by measuring the conductivitythroughout a base titration experiment. A calculated volume containing 0.3 g of nanofibers wasdispersed in 55 mL of DI water. The pH was set between 2.5 and 3.0 by adding 0.1 M HCl. The solutionwas then titrated with 0.4 M NaOH at a rate of 0.1 mL/min until pH reached 11. Throughout thetitration, the pH was measured along with the conductivity. The carboxylate content was calculatedusing the conductivity and pH curves.41Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 706Lignin and Hemicellulose Analysis in Raw Jute Fibers and NOCNFLignin and hemicellulose (total sugar) analysis of the samples was performed by Celignis(Limerick, Ireland). The following analytical procedures were used: (1) acid hydrolysis of samples,(2) determination of acid-soluble lignin (ASL) using Ultraviolet–Visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy,(3) gravimetric determination of klason lignin (KL) and (4) chromatographic analysis of hydrolysate.A detailed explanation of the analytical procedure is provided in Supplementary Materials.Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)The TEM image was obtained with a FEI Tecnai G2 Spirit Bio TWIN instrument (Columbia, MD,United States). The instrument is equipped with a digital camera which allowed it to take photographicfilm. The instrument is also equipped with tilt stage and electron diffraction capabilities. The sampleswere prepared using a 10 μL aliquot sample of 1 mg of NOCNF in 10 mL DI water deposited on carboncoated Copper grids (300 mesh, Ted Pella Inc., Redding, CA, United States). The prepared grid wasthen stained with 2 wt. % aqueous uranyl acetate solution.Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)AFM of NOCNF was performed using a Bruker Dimension ICON scanning probe microscope(Bruker Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA) equipped with a Bruker OTESPA tip (tip radius(max.) = 10 nm). In this measurement, a 10 μL of 0.005 wt. % NOCNF suspension was deposited onthe surface of a silica plate, where the air-dried sample was measured in the tapping mode.Zeta Potential MeasurementsZeta potential of the NOCNF sample was measured by Zeta probe Analyzer (Colloid Dynamics).This instrument consisted of a built-in titration setup equipped with pH electrode and ElectrokineticSonic Amplitude (ESA) sensor probe. Before analyzing the sample, the pH electrode was calibratedusing three different pH buffer standards (pH = 4.01, 7.01 and 10.01), followed by a standard titrationsolution. The ESA sensor was calibrated using the standard zeta probe polar solution (KSiW solution).Upon the completion of calibration test, the NOCNF suspension (0.26 wt. %, 250 mL) was filled in thesample holder, where the ESA sensor was then introduced into the sample under magnetic stirring toanalyze the zeta potential.Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS)The DLS of NRL sample was measured using Nano Brook 90 Plus particle size analyzer(Brookhaven, Holtsville, NY, USA) The DLS graph was set to lognormal plot and the data is anaverage of four total runs to obtain the polydispersity index (PDI).Contact Angle MeasurementStatic contact angle of NRL and composite films prepared by NOCNF and NRL were measuredusing the FDS-contact angle measurement instrument (Model no. OCA 15 EC). Films of NRL aloneand composite films containing NRL and NOCNF were prepared by solvent casting method. A flatportion of film was cut and fixed onto sample holder. A 10 μL drop of deionized water was droppedonto film through a syringe needle operated automatically by syringe pump. The contact angle wasmeasured 20 s after the drop casting to ensure that the water droplet reached its equilibrium position.Tensile TestThe tensile data was obtained using the INSTRON model 4442 device (Instron, Norwood, MA,USA). Clamps were calibrated with a 1.75 cm gap and rectangular samples of 2 cm wide by 5 cm longwere clamped evenly in the device. Elongation rate was set to 60 mm/min with data recording everysecond. Each data plot obtained is an average of three sets of experiments.42Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 706Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)A Zeiss LEO 1550 SFEG-SEM instrument (White Plains NY, USA) was used to record SEM imagesof the samples. The instrument was comprised of an in-lens secondary electron detector in addition tothe standard E-T detector, and a Rutherford backscatter electron detector. It was also equipped withan EDS (energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) system, provides elemental compositions and X-raymaps of the various phases of the materials examined. Images of surface morphology of NRL andNRL composite films were taken to observe the NRL film surface change on addition of NOCNF.3. Results and Discussion3.1. Characterization of NOCNFThe characterization on the surface functionalization of NOCNF extracted from untreated jutefibers was first carried out by FTIR and conductometric titration. Figure 1i demonstrates the FTIRspectra of jute fibers and prepared NOCNF. The characteristic peaks of cellulose are ascribed at (i) 3327cm−1 to O–H stretching vibrations, and at (ii) 2904 cm−1 to CH and CH2 stretching. The prominentpeak in NOCNF at 1591 cm−1 presented the carboxylate groups (–COONa) appeared in NOCNF,which represents the oxidation of anhydroglucose unit at C6 position. Additional peaks at 1372, 1150,1100, and 1030 cm−1 were due to stretching and bending vibrations in glycosidic bonds in cellulose.Other peaks in the FTIR of jute fibers such as 1512; 1732, 1456, 1235 and 808 cm−1 are because ofaromatic symmetrical streching of C=C bonds in the lignin and in hemicellulose units respectively.Interestingly, the peaks belonging to lignin and hemicellulose completely disappear or significantlyreduce in NOCNF, indicating that the nitro-oxidation was resonably effective in removing the ligninand hemicellulsoe impurities from raw jute fibers. The quantitative determination of lignin andhemicelulose in NOCNF was also perfomed to find the exact amount of lignin and hemicellulsoe,which is explained in the next section.NOCNF 0.15 wt. % Figure 1.

The following equation (Equation (1)) was used to determinethe degree of oxidation (DO):DO =MX (V2 −V1)w(1)where M is the molarity of NaOH in mol/L, V2 and V1 is the final and initial volume of NaOH in mL, wis the weight of the NOCNF dried fibers added in grams.43Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 706The conductometric titration plot of NOCNF shown in Figure 1ii indicates its calculated DOvalue which is 0.94 mmol/g. This DO value shows that NOCNF contains a moderate degree ofoxidation, which is further confirmed by zeta potential measurement. The zeta potential measurementdemonstrates the presence of −115 ± 4 mV charge on the NOCNF surface. NOCNF showed gooddispersion in water (inset photograph in Figure 1ii) because of the repulsion caused in between thefibers due to similar charges.The lignin and hemicellulose analysis of raw jute fibers is presented in Table 1. It shows that thetotal hemicellulose (sugar content) and total lignin content (klason lignin (KL) + acid soluble lignin(ASL)) in the raw jute fibers was 68.9% and 17.55%, respectively. However, the total hemicelluloseand lignin content in NOCNF was found as 65% and 1.94% respectively. The results indicate that thereasonable hemicellulose and residual lignin are still present in the NOCNF after the nitro-oxidation.Table 1. Characteristic of carboxycellulsoe nanofibers (NOCNF) obtained from jute.SampleCarboxylateContent(mmol/g)ZetaPotential(mV)ResidualLignin (%)KL/ASL aResidualhemicellulose(%)Length/Width(nm)Thickness(nm)NOCNF 0.94 −115 ± 4 0.58/1.36 65 524 ± 203/7 ± 2 2.9a KL = klason lignin, ASL = acid soluble lignin.The TEM image of NOCNF is shown in Figure 2i. The average fiber length observed for NOCNFwas 524 ± 203 nm and width were in the range of 7 ± 2 nm. However, the AFM of the NOCNF indicatedthe average fibers thickness was 2.9 nm. In this study, the NOCNF obtained has greater width andthickness as compared to the cross section of most of the cellulose fibers where width is in the range of4–5 nm and thickness ~1.5 nm [37]. This is probably due to the chosen nitro-oxidation conditions arerelatively mild, where the presence of residual hemicellulose and lignin contents were still high. Figure 2. (i) Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and (ii) atomic force microscopy (AFM) ofNOCNF extracted from raw jute fibers.The dynamic light scattering (DLS) data measurement of NRL is presented in Figure 3. The datashows that the effective diameter of NRL molecule is 637 nm with polydispersity value of 0.005.This indicates that the NRL is composed of polyisoprene molecules with almost the same size. The TEMmeasurement of NOCNF indicated its fibers length in the range of 524 ± 203 nm, which is almost likethe NRL particles’ size. We have assumed that similar sizes of two interacted molecules NOCNF andNRL will provide the better chances of their physical interaction.44Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 706Figure 3. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) data of natural rubber latex (NRL) (average diameter = 637 nmwith size polydispersity (PDI) = 0.005.3.2. Characterization of Natural Rubber Latex (NRL) and Composite FilmsThe contact angle measurement was performed on the films prepared by NRL and the compositefilms made of NRL and varying content of NOCNF (0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 wt. %), which is shown in Figure 4.The contact angle measurement of pure NRL has shown the average angles (left = 63.8◦ and right = 65◦)clearly indicate that it has hydrophobic surface. An earlier study of the chemically crosslinked NRLfilm (using potassium persulphate (KPS) as an initiator) reported that the contact angle should be inthe range of 94◦, which was clearly more hydrophobic than the noncrosslinked film in the presentstudy [38]. However, the small addition of NOCNF (0.1 wt. %) into NRL has changed the averagecontact angle of composite membrane to be around 49.5 ◦ (left = 51◦ and right = 48◦). The decreasein contact angle indicates the appearance of hydrophilic behavior in composite film because of thepresence of NOCNF which has more hydrophilic groups such as hydroxyl and carboxylate. The furtheraddition of NOCNF (0.2 and 0.4 wt. %) into NRL has further reduced the contact angle of compositefilms (e.g., film with 0.2 wt. % NOCNF: left = 48.4◦ and right = 44◦; film with 0.4 wt. % NOCNF:left = 48◦ and right = 43◦). Interestingly, not much change in the contact angle of composite filmscontaining 0.2 and 0.4 wt. % of NOCNF was observed. This is probably because 0.2 wt.% is theoverlapping concentration of NOCNF [31], where some aggregations might have occurred in the NRLmatrix at and above overlapping concentration (i.e., 0.2 and 0.4 wt. %) of NOCNF, which resulted indecrease in hydrophobicity of the composite films.45Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 706 Figure 4. Contact angle measurements of (i) NRL film (control), and composite films made of NRL andNOCNF with varying concentration of NOCNF (ii) 0.1 wt. %, (iii) 0.2 wt. %, (iv) 0.4 wt.%.3.3. SEM ImagesSEM images of film made of NRL and composite films consisting of NRL and varyingconcentrations NOCNF are presented in Figure 5. The image of NRL in Figure 5i indicates thatthe film possesses uniform surface roughness. This was due to the agglomeration of similar granularshape NRL particles. This was consistent with the size characterization of NRL using the DLStechnique (Figure 3, NRL possessed an average particle size of 640 nm with the polydispersity of 0.005).The morphology of NRL film on addition of 0.1 wt. % of NOCNF (nanofibers) has not shown anysignificant changes on the surface appearance. However, the addition of 0.2 wt. % and 0.4 wt. %nanofibers into NRL (Figure 5iii,iv) resulted in significant changes in surface appearance in termsof roughness.The roughness of the latex film decreases on increasing the amount of nanofibers concentrationabove 0.1 wt. % that could be because of the well distribution of NOCNF with the latex particles. Thesedata correlate well with the contact angle measurement, as the drastic decrease in contact angle from63◦ to 43◦ was observed for the NRL film on addition of 0.1 and 0.2 wt. % of NOCNF. However, thecracks start beginning in composite films containing the (highest) 0.4 wt. % of NOCNF. The probablereason for the crack could be the phase separation in between NRL and NOCNF because of theircorresponding hydrophobic and hydrophilic behavior.46Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 706Figure 5. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images taken at scale bar = 200 nm on (i) NRL film(control), and composite films made of NRL and NOCNF with varying concentration of NOCNF (ii)0.1 wt.%, (iii) 0.2 wt.%, (iv) 0.4 wt.%. Red circles indicate the cracks in the film.3.4. Mechanical Properties of Latex and Composite FilmsThe mechanical properties of NRL and composite films containing NRL and varying concentrationsof NOCNF is shown in Table 2. The stress–strain curve was plotted for all the composite films and ispresented in Figure 6. The stress on the y-axis was calculated by dividing the load by the cross-sectionalarea of the film. The thickness and length of the film is measured using a caliper and all nanocompositesshowed the same thickness of 0.08 cm2. There could be a slight variation of thickness due to theincreased amount of NOCNF added, but the difference would be negligible since the NRL solid amountcontributes to most of the sample’s volume. The stress–strain curves for the NRL and composite filmsalso indicates their ultimate tensile strength (UTS).Table 2. Young’s modulus (Ym), ultimate tensile strength (UTS), and maximum elongation (λmax).Each value is the average of three replicates samples. NRL—pure natural rubber latex, NRL 0.1—NRLcontaining 0.1 wt. % of NOCNF; NRL 0.2—NRL containing 0.2 wt. % of NOCNF; NRL 0.4—NRLcontaining 0.4 wt. % of NOCNF.Sample Ym (kPa) UTS (MPa) λmax (%)NRL 3.3 0.77 234NRL 0.1 79.6 2.5 31.4NRL 0.2 2080 5.2 2.5NRL 0.4 1770 6.2 3.547Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 706Figure 6. Stress–strain curves on (i) NRL film (control), and composite films made of NRL and NOCNFwith varying concentration of NOCNF (ii) 0.1 wt.%, (iii) 0.2 wt.%, (iv) 0.4 wt.%.It was found that the NRL film exhibited the UTS value of 0.77 Mpa. However, the addition ofNOCNF increased the UTS value of the film quite notably (e.g., the films with 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 wt. %of NOCNF showed the UTS value of 2.5, 5.2 and 6.2 MPa, respectively). We note that the ultimatetensile strength reported for the pure NOCNF extracted from jute fibers using the nitro-oxidationmethod was 108 MPa [31] and the chemically crosslinked NRL film typically exhibited the UTS valueof 27 Mpa [39]. In the above study [39], vulcanized (chemically crosslinked) NRL was reinforced byaddition of cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) where the 3 wt. % of CNC was found to be most effectiveto increase the ultimate tensile strength of NRL (by about 29%). In this study, the authors have usedthe term cellulose nanofibers to describe nanocellulose isolated from coconut spathe using the acidhydrolysis method. We believe that the length of such nanocellulose particles extracted by the acidhydrolysis approach should be shorter, the cross-sectional dimensions larger and the crystallinityhigher than those in NOCNF, and they should be termed CNC. It is interesting to note that the overlapconcentration of CNC usually varies between 1.5 wt. % to 3 wt. %, depending on the source of thebiomass [40]. We hypothesize the ultimate tensile strength of vulcanized CNC-NRL also takes placenear the overlap concentration of CNC.On the other side, the maximum elongation (λmax, %) observed in the tested films showed anopposite trend. For example, the pure NRL film exhibited λmax at about 234 %, where 0.1 wt.% ofNOCNF in the composite film decreased the λmax value to 31.4 %. The increase in the NOCNF contentfurther decreased the λmax value (e.g., 0.2 and 0.4 wt. % of NOCNF films showed the λmax value ofaround 2.5% and 3.5%), rendering the films to be quite brittle. These results were consistent with theSEM images (Figure 5), which showed that the addition of NOCNF decreased the roughness of theNRL film and increased the content of cracks owing to phase separation between NOCNF and NRL.The ductile–brittle transition was also noticeable from the Young’s modulus (Ym) evaluationshown in Figure 7. The pure noncrosslinked NRL was very ductile, showing an Ym value of merely3.5 KPa, where 0.1 wt. % of NOCNF addition increased the Ym value to 79.6 KPa and 0.2 wt. % ofNOCNF addition increased the Ym value maximum to 2080 kPa. The further increase of NOCNFcontent decreased the Ym value to 1770 kPa. As a result, the higher NOCNF content would not lead toany property enhancement, where the best content of NOCNF addition appeared to occur near itsoverlap concentration (0.2 wt. %).48Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 706Figure 7. Graph represents the relationship between the Young’s modulus (kPa) and the NOCNFconcentration in the composite films.4. ConclusionsThis study showed that the nitro-oxidized carboxycellulose nanofibers (NOCNF) extracted fromraw jute fibers could be incorporated into the NRL matrix to increase the mechanical properties evenin a nonvulcanized state. The optimal amount of the NOCNF for the overall property improvementseems to take place around the overlap concentration of NOCNF (around 0.2 wt. %). This is notsurprising as the overlap concentration of nanocellulose represents the transition point from a viscousstate to a gel state. Addition of NOCNF into non-vulcanized rubber has changed the NRL film fromelastic to brittle. The more schematic study on latex composite preparation can explore the use ofthese inexpensive and sustainable nanofibers material into the preparation of other rubber-based (e.g.,Guayule) composite materials.Supplementary Materials: The following are available online at http://www.mdpi.com/2079-4991/10/4/706/s1.Author Contributions: Methodology, H.C. and K.J.; software, S.L.; validation, P.R.S., S.K.S. and B.S.H.; formalanalysis, R.W. and W.B.; data curation, C.Z.; writing—original draft preparation, S.K.S. and S.L.; writing—reviewand editing, P.R.S. and B.S.H.; supervision, P.R.S., S.K.S. and B.S.H.; funding acquisition, B.S.H.

ChNF wasisolated using the aqueous counter collision (ACC) method, while CNF was isolated using thecombination of TEMPO oxidation and the ACC method, which resulted in smaller size of CNFthan that of ChNF. The prepared composite was characterized in terms of morphologies, FT-IR,UV visible, thermal stability, mechanical properties, hygroscopic behaviors, and antioxidant activity.The composite was flexible enough to be bent without cracking. Better UV-light protection wasshown at higher content of ChNF in the composite. The high ChNF content showed the highestantioxidant activity in the composite. It is the first time that a simple combination of ChNF–CNFcomposites fabrication showed good mechanical properties and antioxidant activities. In this study,the reinforcement effect of the composite was addressed. The ChNF–CNF composite is promising foractive food packaging application.Keywords: cellulose nanofiber; chitosan nanofiber; composite; mechanical properties; antioxidantactivity1. IntroductionNowadays, the use of renewable materials instead of plastics is essential since the proliferationof plastics in the environment has been known to create various health and ecological problems.An example of extensive use of plastics is packaging. Recently, packaging was identified as an essentialelement to address the key challenge of sustainable food consumption [1]. When a food product isthrown away, the packaging is also discarded, leading to an additional environmental burden. Thus,petroleum-based packaging materials need to be replaced with renewable materials.Chitosan, the second most abundant material after cellulose on Earth, is renewable, biodegradable,biocompatible, non-toxic and capable of transporting antioxidants [2–4]. Chitosan has been investigatedfor various applications including drug delivery, artificial skin, wound-dressing and biomedical andpharmaceutical applications [5]; contact lens and, water filtration [6]; food packaging [7–9]; and fruitpreservations such as tomatoes, carrots and raw shrimps [10–13]. Chitosan does not cause anyintrinsic food contamination such as phthalate leaching, thus has emerged as suitable alternatives forcommercial plastics. Chitosan can be formed as a nanofiber. Chitosan nanofiber (ChNF) is beneficial tovarious applications since it has high aspect ratio, good chemical/physical interaction and flexibility.Most ChNFs can be fabricated by electro-spinning process including dissolving and purifying steps [14].Instead of dissolving, ChNF can be isolated from its raw materials by physical methods, for example,Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 1752; doi:10.3390/nano10091752 www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials53Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 1752by using supermasscolloider and high water jet pressure, above 200 MPa [15,16]. ChNF is consideredfor many applications such as removal of Arsenate [17], biomedical applications [18,19] and filtrationmembranes [14,20].Cellulose, the most abundant polymer on Earth, has been used for long time. However, it hasbecome a very interesting subject in recent years due to its possibility for substituting petroleum-basedmaterials, and it is readily available around the world. Cellulose has been used for a wide varietyof applications such as paper, packaging, composites, textiles, biomedical and pharmaceuticalapplications [21,22]. Cellulose nanofiber (CNF) is a nano-sized fiber in the range of ten to a couplehundred nanometers. Since CNF has merits over cellulose nanocrystals, its market is remarkablyincreasing for various applications [23]. It can be prepared mainly by mechanical and chemical methods.2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxylradical-oxidation (TEMPO-oxidation) is a chemical method toextract CNF from various cellulose resources [24,25].Cellulose and chitosan have been studied for food packaging materials [3,4,21,22]. It is well-knownthat chitosan has antibacterial, antioxidant and good food preservation properties. Cellulose hasalso been used as a food packaging material for long time. Early studies explored cellulose–chitosancomposites for food packaging materials [26,27]. However, the blending of CNFs and ChNF has notbeen employed in any advance research, which could be applicable for food packaging. Thus, in thisresearch, two types of nanofibers, namely CNF and ChNF, were blended for a potential active foodpackaging material. IThe ChNF was isolated using a physical treatment, so-called, aqueous countercollision (ACC) method [28]. CNF was also prepared from softwood pulp using a combination ofchemical method, TEMPO-oxidation, and the ACC method to further decrease its size. We intended todistinguish the ChNF and CNF size to blend them with different morphologies. The prepared ChNFand CNF were directly blended to prepare ChNF–CNF composites. The advantages of blending CNFand ChNF are simple and benign preparation. Furthermore, by distributing various sizes of ChNF andCNF, physical and functional properties of the composite can be controlled. Active food packagingor smart packaging for food products refers to packaging that has functionalities in protecting theproducts. Those functionalities include preserving freshness and antimicrobial activity. Previousstudies have reported that chitosan exhibits the functionalities suitable for active food packaging, forexample antioxidant behavior and antimicrobial activity [3,7,10]. Thus, owing to functionalities ofchitosan, the ChNF–CNF composite can be an active food packaging material.To evaluate the morphology of CNF and ChNF, several techniques are available, for examplescanning electron microscope (SEM), atomic force microscope (AFM), transmission electron microscope(TEM) and particle size analyzer. The size distributions of CNF and ChNF are very broad dependingon the isolation methods. ChNF prepared by electrospinning exhibited a diameter ranging from 70to 330 nm [18]; 260 nm with beads [29]; from 128 to 153 nm without beads [17]; and between 3 nmand few microns, at which the large diameter of nanofiber was due to self-assembly of ChNF [30].The ChNF produced by grinder and high-pressure homogenizer yielded around 88 nm in diameter [31].When chitosan nanoparticles were prepared by dissolving then slowly precipitating them in sodiumtripolyphosphate solution, the chitosan nanoparticles exhibited a diameter of around 164 nm [32].In the case of CNF, the TEMPO-oxidized CNF exhibited its width between 3 nm and few micronsin length [25]. Its morphology was also investigated by AFM and, after centrifugal fractionation,the average width of the CNF was reduced to 2.0 ± 0.6 nm [33]. Depending on the treatment conditions,not only the size distribution, but also the physical properties including the thermal properties andcrystallinity index can be varied. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been any research focusedon the conversion of chitosan to ChNF by using ACC method. Furthermore, no research has beenattempted to explore ChNF and CNF composites applicable for active food packaging. ChNF–CNFcomposites can be easily prepared just by blending ChNF and CNF.Therefore, in this paper, we investigated the effect of ACC treatment conditions on the propertiesof ChNF, and prepared ChNF–CNF composites by simply blending two nanofibers, which can beapplicable for an active food packaging material. The prepared ChNF–CNF composites as well as54Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 1752ChNF were characterized in terms of morphology, hygroscopic behavior and chemical interaction,as well as thermal, optical, mechanical and antioxidant properties.2. Materials and Methods2.1. MaterialsLow molecular weight Chitosan was purchased from Sigma Aldrich. The chitosan sampleswere dipped in deionized (DI) water for at least 30 min before subjected to ACC treatment.Softwood bleached kraft pulp was received from Chungnam National University, Daejeon,South Korea. 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxylradical (TEMPO 98%), sodium bromide (NaBr99%) and hydrochloric acid (HCl 37%) were purchase from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA.Sodium hypochlorite solution (NaClO 12%) was purchase from Yakuri Pure Chemicals Co. Ltd. Uji,Japan. Sodium hydroxide anhydrous (NaOH 98%) was purchase from Daejung, South Korea.2.2. Chitosan Nanofiber PreparationACC is a water jet system that uses two high-pressure (200 MPa) water jets colliding with eachother to produce a high shear force so as to isolate nanofibers from the original suspension [28,34].ACC is a benign and environmentally friendly isolation method. Thus, ACC was selected for ChNFisolation by using an ACC machine (ACCNAC–100, CNNT, Korea). The nozzle size of two water jetswas 160 μm in diameter. Chitosan suspension of 1% concentration was fed to the ACC machine toextract the ChNF. Different passes of chitosan suspension through the ACC machine was done at 10,15 and 30 passes. The number of pass indicates how many times the suspension goes through theACC chamber.2.3. Cellulose Nanofiber PreparationTo isolate CNF, a combination of chemical method, TEMPO-oxidation and the ACC method wasadopted to further decrease the size of CNF. Dried bleached softwood kraft pulp was dipped in DIwater for at least 30 min followed by disintegration under high speed food mixer for 10 min. The pulpwas then subjected to TEMPO-oxidation treatment by using the chemicals: TEMPO 0.013 g/g, NaBr0.13 g/g and NaClO 12% 4 mL/g-cellulose. The pH 10 was adjusted by addition of 0.1 M NaOH, and thereaction time was set to 90 min. After the reaction, the TEMPO-oxidized cellulose was neutralized withHCl 0.1 M, followed by the addition of methanol to stop the reaction. The TEMPO-oxidized cellulosewas washed several times with DI water.The TEMPO-oxidized softwood cellulose was first homogenized by using a homogenizer (IKAT25, IKA, Staufen, Germany) for 10 min at 10,000 rpm to strip off any bundled fibers before goingto ACC for smooth treatment. The cellulose suspension was passed through the ACC machine for10 passes. The transparency and morphology of the prepared CNF were determined by using UVspectroscopy, FE-SEM and AFM.2.4. ChNF–CNF Composites PreparationTo prepare the composites, the CNF was used as a matrix and ChNF was blended to reinforce thecomposites. The blended suspensions were mixed by using the homogenizer (IKA 25) for 10 min at10,000 rpm. The mixture was then cast on a polycarbonate substrate by using a doctor blade in a cleanroom and left to dry on air. The weight percent of ChNF was changed to 3%, 5%, 7%, 10%, 15% and20%, and the composites were named as CTS3, CTS5, CTS7, CTS10, CTS15 and CTS20, respectively.The thickness of the prepared ChNF–CNF composites was between 40 and 45 μm.55Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 17522.5. Characterizations2.5.1. MorphologyMorphologies of the prepared ChNF as well as ChNF–CNF composites were investigated byusing a field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, S-4,000, Hitachi, Japan) and an atomicforce microscopy (AFM, Veeco 3100, USA). Since the morphologies of CNF are well reported [21–25],they are not repeated in this paper.2.5.2. FTIR SpectraFTIR spectra of the ChNF–CNF composites and ChNF were determined using a FTIR spectroscopy(Cary 630, Agilent Technol. Santa Clara, CA, USA) with a diamond crystal that has the wavelengthrange from 650 to 4000 cm−1. The specimens were tested for the absorbance between 650 and 4000 cm−1with accumulation of 32 scans and the data were collected at a resolution of 4 cm−1.2.5.3. X-ray Diffraction (XRD)The crystallinity index (CrI) of ChNF and ChNF–CNF composites were measured using an X-raydiffractometer (XRD, X’Pert PRO MRD, Malvern). It is hard to make chitosan particles into a thin filmof 45–70 g/m2. Thus, the pure chitosan was used in powder form. A thin ChNF film of 40–45 μm wascast on a polycarbonate substrate by using the doctor blade, and 2 × 2 cm2 specimens were prepared toevaluate the CrI. The CrI of chitosan was calculated using the following equation [7].CrI (%) = (I002 − Iam)/I002 ∗ 100 (%) (1)where I002 is XRD peak at 2θ = 19.7◦ and Iam is diffraction pattern of amorphous area at 2θ = 15◦.The prepared ChNF–CNF composites were directly used for XRD.2.5.4. Mechanical PropertiesTensile test was performed to evaluate the mechanical properties of the prepared ChNF–CNFcomposites by using a tensile test machine [35]. Specimens were cut to the size of 0.5× 5 cm2. The lengthbetween grips was 3 cm. The specimen thickness was varied from 40 to 45 μm. Dried samples werekept in a condition chamber (30% RH and 25 ◦C) for at least 8 h before the tensile test, and fivespecimens were tested for each case. The ChNF specimen was prepared by casting it and tested alsofor comparison.2.5.5. Thermogravimetric AnalysisThermal stability of the prepared ChNF and ChNF–CNF composites were analyzed by usingThermogravimetric analyzer (TGA, STA 409PC, NETZSCH, Selb, Germany). Seven milligrams of thesample were prepared and thermally induced starting from 30 ◦C until 500 ◦C.2.5.6. ViscosityThe viscosity of the prepared ChNF suspension was investigated by using a viscometer (LV DV2T,Brookfield viscometer, USA). The spindle LV–04 (64), speed 0.1 rpm, T = 23.5 ◦C and time recordedfrom 1 to 5 min were chosen for the test condition, and 0.8 wt% of ChNF suspensions were provided.The ChNF yield was investigated by using centrifugation at 7000 rpm for 1 h.2.5.7. UV–TransmittanceThe UV transmittance of the prepared ChNF and ChNF–CNF composites were investigatedby using a UV spectrometer (HP 845×, Hewlett-Packard, Hayward, CA, USA). Suspensions of thespecimens were used to measure the UV transmittance at the wavelength range of 200–800 nm.56Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 17522.5.8. Hygroscopic BehaviorsWater contact angle (WCA) measurement of the pure CNF and ChNF–CNF composites wascarried out. A drop of 5 μL was deposited on a thin film and the images were taken by AMcap softwareand then analyzed using ImageJ tool. Water vapor transmittance rate (WVTR) was tested accordingto ASTM standard E 96-95 [36]. The sample was kept in a humidity chamber at 25 ◦C and 50% RH.The WVTR was taken hourly for up to 8 h continuously2.5.9. Antioxidant PropertyThe antioxidant activity of the prepared ChNF–CNF composites was tested by using ABTS freeradical [37]. The antioxidant activity analysis was based on the discolored radicals of ATBS after 40 minunder UV light measurement at 734 nm. The UV absorption was adjusted to absorption at 0.8; 20 mg ofCNF, ChNF and ChNF–CNF composites in 2 mL of ABTS were used for the measurement after 40 min.In other words, various chitosan contents (at 0.03, 0.05, 0.07, 0.1, 0.15 and 0.2 mg/mL of ABTS) wereused. All antiradical tests were carried out twice for each sample. Then, 7 mM ABTS was dissolved inDI water and mixed with 2.45 mM potassium persulfate and kept in a dark drawer for 16 h. After that,the ABTS suspension was diluted with methanol to adjust the absorption of 0.8 at wavelength 734 nm.The antioxidant activity of CNF and ChNF–CNF composites was calculated by the following equation:AO(%) = 100 ∗ (1−Aa/Ao) (2)where AO is the antiradical activity, Ao is the absorption of the control ABTS solution and Aa is theabsorption of the ABTS solution with sample in steady state.3. Results3.1. Chitosan NanofibersFigure 1 shows the photograph of ChNF suspensions treated with 10, 15 and 30 passes of the ACCtreatment. After ACC treatment, the suspensions were changed to ivory color, and as the ACC passincreased the suspension color turned to a milky. The viscosity of ChNF suspensions was measuredand Figure 2 shows the result. The viscosity of ChNF suspensions increased with the number of ACCpass. The higher is the number of passes at the ACC chamber, the higher is the viscosity of ChNF.Higher viscosity means a higher fibrillation of chitosan, thus reducing its size to nanofibers. Note thatthe low viscosity ChNF samples (10 and 15 ACC passes) easily flowed when the samples were placedupside down, while the 30 passes case did not flow when it was placed upside down. Interestingly,the viscosity values decreased with the time especially, for the 15 and 30 passes cases. This might beassociated with the broken inner bonds in ChNF and the layer separation in the suspension. Figure 2bshows the viscosity change with the number of ACC pass when the time is 5 min. The viscosity linearlyincreased with the number of ACC pass.The yield of ChNF was evaluated in each sample by centrifugation. The result shows that, after 10,15 and 30 passes of the ACC treatment, the yields of ChNF were 13.2%, 15.5% and 27.7%, respectively.From the viscosity and yield data, it is clear that the higher is the number of ACC passes, the better isthe isolation of ChNF.The morphology changes of chitosan after the ACC treatment were observed by FE-SEM andAFM. Figure 3a–d shows the morphologies of the original chitosan and ChNFs with 10, 15 and 30passes of the ACC treatment, respectively. The chitosan particles were around 50–100 μm. After theACC treatment, it was changed to nanofibers, as shown in Figure 3b–d. After 30 passes, the ChNFsize was reduced to 38 ± 16.5 nm in width and length of several microns. The width of ChNF wascalculated in 100 measurements from the AFM images. This size of ChNF is larger and longer thanthat of CNF. Thus, in the preparation of ChNF–CNF composites, 30 passed ChNF was chosen.57Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 1752Figure 1.

ChNF–CNF Composites3.2.1. MorphologiesThe morphologies of the ChNF–CNF composite structure were investigated. Figure 4 showsthe SEM images of the ChNF–CNF composite and CNF film. Figure 4a shows a smooth surfaceof the CNF film and Figure 4b is the cross-section SEM image of the CNF film, which exhibits thelayer-by-layer structure of CNF. After blending with ChNF, the surface of ChNF–CNF compositeturned out to be rough. The cross-section SEM image of the composite also shows a layer-by-layerstructure similar to the CNF film. It was shown that the ChNF was well blended with CNF to maintainthe layer-by-layer structure.Figure 4. FE-SEM images of: (a) surface of CNF film; (b) cross section of CNF film; (c) surface ofChNF–CNF composite; and (d) cross section of ChNF–CNF composite.In addition, to consider ChNF–CNF composites for packaging, the composites should be bendable.Thus, a quick bending test was performed with the ChNF–CNF composite. The composites were soflexible that they could be bent in any direction without cracking. The thickness of the composites was inthe range of 40–50 μm. Figure 5 shows flexibility of the composite in bending and rolling deformation.Figure 5. Flexibility of ChNF–CNF composite by: (a) bending; and (b) rolling.59Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 17523.2.2. FTIRFigure 6 shows the FTIR spectra of the CNF, ChNF and ChNF–CNF composites with different ChNFconcentration. The peak in the range of 3200–3500 cm−1 of the ChNF–CNF composites was assigned tothe hydrogen-bonded O–H stretching in both CNF and ChNF. Chitosan showed broader O–H bondedas compared to cellulose with higher intensity. Due to the combination of these two materials, with20% chitosan, the intensity of the peak at 3200–3500 cm−1 appeared similar to pure chitosan. The CNFshowed stronger and higher peak of hydrogen-bonding than the ChNF. When ChNF and CNF wereblended, peaks at 3000 and 3500 cm−1 were reduced, which might be due to the intra-bonding betweentwo materials. The peak at 1596 cm−1 assigned for –C=O stretching is clear for CNF. The peak at1736 cm−1 was assigned for the C=O stretch of the –COOH group. This was only observed in the CNFat first, and the intensity of this peak decreased due to the addition of ChNF. At last, this peak becameweak and disappeared when the ChNF concentration increased. This phenomenon indicates theinteraction between ChNF and CNF. The peak at 1596 cm−1 only appeared for cellulose and compositesbut not clearly shown for chitosan. This peak might be associated with the aromatic ring stretching oflignin or hemicellulose remained small amount in the bleached kraft pulp. From the FT-IR analysis,the structure of CNF and ChNFs were confirmed in the composites.Figure 6. FTIR of CNF, ChNF and ChNF–CNF composites.3.2.3. Crystallinity IndexThe crystallinity index (CrI) of the original chitosan and ChNF were obtained by XRD andcalculated according to Equation 1 as shown in Figure 7a. The crystalline peaks of chitosan appearedat 9.7◦ and 19.7◦. The peak at 19.7◦ decreased by the ACC treatment, while the strong peak at 9.7◦increased, which might be associated with the incorporation of bound water molecules of α-chitin [38].It means that a higher ACC treatment leads to more water molecules bound on hydrophilic surface ofChNF. The CrI values of the original chitosan and ChNFs with 10, 15 and 30 ACC passes were shownto be 65.4%, 44.0%, 44.0% and 36.2%, respectively. The CrI of chitosan highly degraded after ACCtreatment. Note that 30 ACC passed ChNF was used for the ChNF–CNF composite preparation.60Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 1752Figure 7. Crystallinity index of: (a) ChNF with number of ACC passes; and (b) CNF andChNF–CNF composites.The XRD patterns of the ChNF–CNF composites are shown in Figure 7b with different ACCpasses. As one can see, cellulose peaks at around 15.8◦ and 22.7◦ were clearly shown and as the ChNFcontent increased, chitosan peaks were slightly appeared by interfering with cellulose peaks. Thus, CrIof the composites was calculated mainly by the dominant cellulose peaks at 22.7◦. The CrI values forlow ChNF content composites slight improved at low chitosan content (ChNF3 and ChNF5) from 63%to 65%, and then it slightly decreased to 58% with addition of ChNF content. This might be due togood miscibility between ChNF and CNF.3.2.4. Mechanical PropertiesTensile test was performed for ChNF, CNF and ChNF–CNF composites and the results are shownin Table 1. The tensile strength of the composite at first was 174.5 MPa (no ChNF), reached 224.0 MPawhen the ChNF content was 10% and then decreased thereafter. Note that mechanical properties ofthe pristine ChNF is much lower than the CNF, i.e. more flexible than the CNF. Similarly, the yieldstrength of the composite was initially 111.7 MPa and reached its maximum of 149.0 MPa when theChNF content was 10%. It was shown that the elongation at break of the composite increased from2.02% to 4.17% and then decreased. It was shown that, when reinforced by ChNF, the tensile strength,yield strength and elongation at break of the composite improved. However, Young’s modulus of thecomposite was not improved and slightly decreased due to the low modulus of ChNF. The modulus ofChNF is 7.3 GPa, while that of CNF is 16.9 GPa.Table 1. Tensile test results of ChNF, CNF and their composites.SamplesYoung’s Modulus(GPa)Yield Strength(MPa)Tensile Strength(MPa)Elongation atBreak (%)CNF 16.9 + 2.6 111.7 + 57 174.5 + 56.0 2.02CTS3 13.9 + 2.1 100.2 + 23 183.1 + 60.8 2.06CTS5 15.2 + 4.0 124.6 + 17 197.5 + 32.0 2.46CTS7 13.2 + 0.5 136.2 + 80 216.5 + 95.7 2.85CTS10 12.9 + 0.9 149.0 + 20 224.0 + 27.0 4.17CTS15 13.5 + 2.3 131.8 + 23 198.0 + 31.4 3.40CTS20 15.8 + 2.7 104.4 + 22 157.1 + 30.5 1.79ChNF * 7.3 + 0.70 87.5 + 26.8 133.4 + 17.9 3.69* when number of ACC passes is 30.Nevertheless, the overall mechanical properties of the composite were improved, which mightbe due to the reinforcement of ChNF to CNF in the composite. Most previous studies producedcellulose–chitosan composites by dissolving chitosan or cellulose and blending them [2,32]. However,61Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 1752in this research, we adopted the non-dissolving method to prepare ChNF–CNF composites, and aremarkable improvement of the mechanical properties of the ChNF–CNF composite was observed.There could be several mechanisms that can explain the mechanical properties improvement of thecomposite. The first one is improvement of the bonding sites between ChNF and CNF due to differentsize of ChNF and CNF. Note that the ChNF size was larger than that of CNF. The long length ofChNF in the CNF matrix and high surface areas of CNF created many reaction sites and bondingareas on their surfaces. Furthermore, the CNF is relatively stiff and ChNF is flexible. The mismatchedmechanical properties of ChNF and CNF could give a room for managing the composite mechanicalproperties. Figure 8 shows the possible concept of reinforcement in the composite. By blendingthese two heterogeneous polysaccharide nanofibers, we can manage the mechanical properties of thecomposite. It is hoped that this idea could be a way to produce cellulose–chitosan composites withbetter mechanical properties without dissolving process of chitosan or cellulose.Figure 8. A possible reinforcement mechanism of ChNF and CNF composite.3.2.5. Thermal StabilityThe thermal stability of ChNF, CNF and their composites were examined by TGA, and the resultsare shown in Figure 9. At 30 to 100 ◦C of the evaporation stage, there was no significant difference in thefirst stage of water evaporation in the composites except ChNF. The CNF and their composites startedto degrade around 200 ◦C and reached around 320 ◦C for the first phase of degradation, while ChNFstarted to degrade near 250 ◦C. The composites showed almost the same thermal degradation range asthe CNF. It can be seen that they are stable up to 250 ◦C. Note that the CNF and ChNF exhibited largerresiduals than the composites. The residuals after 320 ◦C was around 40–50% for CNF and ChNF.The reason for larger residuals of the CNF and ChNF than the composites is under investigation.Figure 9. TGA of ChNF–CNF composites.62Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 17523.2.6. UV TransmittanceUV protection of ChNF–CNF composites is an important factor for food packaging applications.UV transmission of the composites was evaluated, and the results are shown in Figure 10. As comparedto the neat CNF, the ChNF–CNF composites showed better UV-protection. Higher CTS content showedbetter the UV protection. In the range of UV-A, UV-B, and UV-C, CTS10, CTS15 and CTS20 exhibitedhigher UV protection than CTS3, CTS5 and CTS7. However, transparency of the composites is sacrificedto improve the UV protection. Thus, good UV protection with maintaining good transparency isfuture work.Figure 10. UV-transmittance of ChNF–CNF composites.3.2.7. Hygroscopic BehaviorsWCA and WVTR were tested to investigate the hygroscopic behaviors of the composites. Table 2shows the results. The WVTR was a little increased at first by the addition of ChNF up to 10% andthen saturated thereafter. This result shows a good agreement with the previous research for CNFand acetylated CNF [22]. Regarding the WCA of the composites, it was rather a bit decreased byadding ChNF, which indicates hydrophilic behavior of the composites. This hydrophilic behaviormight be associated with the hydroxyl groups appeared on the surface of the composites. Enhancingthis behavior is future work in this research.Table 2.

Antioxidant PropertyThe antioxidant abilities of CNF, ChNF and ChNF–CNF composites were investigated andexpressed in AOA%/100 mg, as shown in Figure 11. The antioxidant activities of CNF, ChNF, CTS3,CTS5, CTS7, CTS10, CTS15 and CTS20 were 16.9%, 27.9%, 19.4%, 23.4%, 23.4%, 33.4%, 47.4% and52.0%, respectively. The CTS20 showed the highest antioxidant activity among all cases. Interestingly,although the CNF and ChNF have low antioxidant activities, when they were blended together,63Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 1752the antioxidant activity of the composites increased. Cellulose and chitosan are both polysaccharides,and, when they are combined, the reducing ends of the materials may open, thus increasing theantioxidant activity. Nanofibrillation can also increase the hydroxyl groups, which are good forantioxidant activities. The antioxidant activity is the interaction of free radicals with the hydroxylgroups, and free amino groups of the chitosan and cellulose [39,40]. The improvement of antioxidantactivities of the composites is agreeable with the previous research [39], which showed a steady increaseof the antioxidant activity of the composites by increasing the chitosan content.Figure 11. Antioxidant of ChNF–CNF composites.4. ConclusionsIn this research, ChNF was isolated by using the ACC method and increasing the number of ACCpasses reduced the size and increased the yield of ChNF. Isolating CNF by using the combination ofTEMPO oxidation and the ACC method resulted in smaller size than that of ChNF. By blending twoheterogeneous polysaccharide nanofibers, we were able to prepare ChNF–CNF composites. ChNF waswell blended with CNF so as to maintain the layer-by-layer structure of the composites. The compositeswere so flexible that they could be bent in any direction without cracking. From the FT-IR analysis,the structure of CNF and ChNFs were confirmed in the composites. The composites showed remarkableimprovement of the mechanical properties, which might be due to the reinforcement of ChNF to CNFin the composites. The composites showed almost the same thermal degradation range of the CNF.Better UV-light protection was shown at higher content of ChNF in the composites. The WVTR wasslightly increased at first by the addition of ChNF up to 10% and then saturated thereafter. The WCAof the composites was rather slightly decreased by adding ChNF, and enhancing this behavior is futurework. The high ChNF content showed the highest antioxidant activity in the composites. Although theCNF and ChNF had low antioxidant activities, their blended composites had increased the antioxidantactivity. It is the first time a simple combination of ChNF–CNF composites fabrication showed goodmechanical properties and antioxidant activities.

In this study, nano-cellulose MOF-derived carbon-doped CuO/Fe3O4nanocomposites were successfully synthesized via direct calcination of magnetic Cu-BTC MOF(HKUST-1)/Fe3O4/cellulose microfibril (CMF) composites in air. The morphology, structure,and porous properties of carbon-doped CuO/Fe3O4 nanocomposites were characterized using SEM,TEM, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and vibrating samplemagnetometry (VSM). The results show that the as-prepared nanocomposite catalyst is composed ofFe3O4, CuO, and carbon. Compared to the CuO/Fe3O4 catalyst from HKUST-1/Fe3O4 composite andCuO from HKUST-1, this carbon-doped CuO/Fe3O4 nanocomposite catalyst shows better catalyticefficiency in reduction reactions of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP), methylene blue (MB), and methyl orange(MO) in the presence of NaBH4. The enhanced catalytic performance of carbon-doped CuO/Fe3O4is attributed to effects of carbon preventing the aggregation of CuO/Fe3O4 and providing highsurface-to-volume ratio and chemical stability. Moreover, this nanocomposite catalyst is readilyrecoverable using an external magnet due to its superparamagnetic behavior. The recyclability/reuseof carbon-doped CuO/Fe3O4 was also investigated.Keywords: nano-cellulose; MOF; carbon-doped CuO/Fe3O4 nanocatalyst; catalytic reduction;pollutant remedy1. IntroductionRecently, metal nanoparticles (NPs) were widely used in the fields of biomedicine and chemicalreactions due to their high selectivity and catalytic efficiency [1–3]. Noble-metal nanoparticles(gold, silver, etc.) [4–6] and non-noble-metal nanoparticles (copper, zinc, and their oxides, sulfides,etc.) [7–10] are particularly noticeable. For example, Jiang et al. [11] reported that CuO and Audomains could greatly improve the photocatalytic activity and stability of Cu2O cubes in thephotocatalytic degradation of methyl orange (MO). Rodríguez et al. [12] reported that potassiumpoly(heptazine imide) (PHIK)/Ti-based metal–organic framework (MIL-125-NH2) composites hadsuperior photocatalytic activity in rhodamine B (RhB) degradation under blue-light irradiation.Among the applications, metal nanoparticles can also be used for treating wastewater and drinkingwater due to their large surface areas and high activity [13,14]. With growing focus on the developmentNanomaterials 2019, 9, 277; doi:10.3390/nano9020277 www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials67Nanomaterials 2019, 9, 277of cost-effective, efficient catalysts, more attention is being paid to non-noble-metal catalysts, such asmetal-oxide catalysts.Metal NPs with nanometer-scale dimensions are unstable and tend to aggregate due to theirhigh surface energy and surface area, which can lead to the loss of catalytic efficiency [15–17].The concept of immobilization/stabilization of metal NPs onto support/substrates is one of theeffective methods to overcome aggregation of NPs [18,19]. There are many types of substrates/matricesthat can be used to support metal NPs, such as carbon [20,21], silica [22], metal oxide [23],polymers, etc. [24–26]. Carbon, as a support for metal nanoparticles, provides multiple accessiblechannels for diffusion/transport to take advantage of the excellent catalytic functionalities of metalnanoparticles [27].In past decades, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) attracted much attention due to theirporous structures and potential applications in gas storage, molecule separation, chemical sensing,drug delivery, and catalysis [28–30]. Recently, MOF-based derivative catalysts received more attentionbecause MOF-derived materials have advantages in terms of tailorable morphologies, hierarchicalporosity, and easy functionalization with other heteroatoms and metal oxides [31,32]. For instance,Ji et al. used ZIF-67 as a precursor to synthesize a Pt@Co3O4 composite to improve the catalytic activityof CO oxidation [33]. Yang et al. reported that ZnO nanoparticles prepared via calcination of MOF-5 inair at 600 ◦C showed excellent photocatalytic degradation of rhodamine B [34]. Niu et al. synthesizeda hybrid catalyst consisting of Cu/Cu2O NPs supported on porous carbon for the catalytic reductionof 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) using HKUST-1 as a precursor [27].The direct pyrolysis/thermolysis treatment of MOFs is a simple and controllable method toprepare various metal oxides in a one-step process. By following it, we can successfully synthesizecarbon-doped CuO/Fe3O4 composite catalysts for organic pollutant reduction. Herein, we preparedcarbon-doped CuO/Fe3O4 composite catalysts via direct calcination of HKUST-1/Fe3O4/CMFcomposites under air. We then applied the as-prepared carbon-doped CuO/Fe3O4 composite catalystsfor the catalytic reduction of 4-NP. Its catalytic performance, in comparison with a CuO/Fe3O4composite from HKUST-1/Fe3O4 composite and CuO, is remarkably better, which is attributedto the fact that carbon doping can (1) minimize the aggregation of CuO/Fe3O4, (2) provide highsurface-to-volume ratio and chemical stability for the catalyst in contact with the target pollutants,and (3) enhance the catalytic activity of the CuO/Fe3O4 catalyst. Furthermore, the carbon-dopedCuO/Fe3O4 composite catalyst has excellent efficiency in the reduction of methylene blue (MB) andmethyl orange (MO). The features of the carbon-doped CuO/Fe3O4 composite catalyst are as follows:CuO acts as the effective catalyst, with the doped carbon having the three functions discussed, and themagnetic Fe3O4 supports easy reuse/recycling of the catalyst using a magnet.2. Experimental2.1. MaterialsCellulose microfibrils (CMF) (~4.0 wt.%) from Cellulose Lab; trimesic acid (H3BTC), copper (II)acetate monohydrate, ethanol, and hydrochloric acid (HCl, 37%, w/w) from Sigma-Aldrich; methyleneblue, ferric nitrate nonahydrate (Fe(NO3)3·9H2O), ferrous sulfate (FeSO4·7H2O), citric acid anhydrous,and sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 50%, w/w) from Fisher Scientific were used in this study. All otherchemicals were of analytical grade and used without further purification.2.2. Synthesis of Magnetic Carbon-Doped CuO/Fe3O4 Nanocomposite CatalystFe3O4/cellulose microfibril (CMF) composites were prepared using chemical co-precipitation ofaqueous ferrous and ferric ions, and the procedures were similar to those described in the literature [35].CMF (7.5 g, ~4%, w/w) was diluted to 0.3 wt.% with distilled water and stirred for 5 min at1000 rpm. The diluted CMF suspension was further treated in a sonicator (QSON-ICA) for 5 min todisperse the individual nanocellulose, followed by heating at 65 ◦C and bubbling with nitrogen for68Nanomaterials 2019, 9, 27710 min under magnetic stirring (500 rpm) to remove the dissolved oxygen from the CMF suspension.Then, citric acid (1 mg) and diluted HCl solution (1 mL, 2 mol/L) were added to the above solution,followed by the successive additions of 1.3 mmol Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and 0.65 mmol FeSO4·7H2O solidsamples with nitrogen bubbling and magnetic stirring. The function of citric acid was to protectthe as-prepared Fe3O4 NPs from being oxidized by the dissolving oxygen in water. A dilute NaOHsolution (10 mL, 2 mol/L) was added drop-wise into the above system, followed by bubbling withnitrogen and magnetic stirring (500 rpm) for 120 min at room temperature. The obtained Fe3O4/CMFcomposites (using a magnet) were washed three times with distilled water in a centrifugation step(4000 rpm, 10 min).Copper (II) acetate monohydrate was dissolved in distilled water. Fe3O4/CMF nanocompositesand H3BTC were dispersed in ethanol and then treated in a sonicator (QSON-ICA) for 5 min.The ethanol solution containing Fe3O4/CMF composite and H3BTC was added to the aqueous system.The color of the solution changed from light blue to blue-black immediately, and the system was stirredcontinuously for 4 h. The final HKUST-1/Fe3O4/CMF composite was washed in a centrifugation step(4000 rpm, 10 min) with distilled water and absolute ethanol three times. Then, the drying was done at50 ◦C under vacuum.The synthesized HKUST-1/Fe3O4/CMF composites were placed in a ceramic boat,then transferred to a muffle roaster, which was operated under the conditions of 500 ◦C, air atmosphere,and a heating rate of 20 ◦C/min, before being held at 500 ◦C for 5 h; the procedures were similar tothose described in the literature [36]. After cooling to room temperature, the sample was washedseveral times with distilled water and absolute ethanol in a centrifugation step (4000 rpm, 10 min),and finally dried in a vacuum at 60 ◦C for 5 h.2.3. CharacterizationTransmission electron microscope (TEM) analyses were conducted with a JEOL JEM 2011transmission electron microscope at 200 kV. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analyses wereconducted with a JEOL JSM 6400 scanning electron microscope. The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD)patterns of the prepared samples were collected using an X-ray diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation(40 kV, 30 mA). The patterns were recorded in the region of 2θ from 10◦ to 80◦ with a scan step of0.02◦. The chemical binding energies of the respective ions in the samples were measured using X-rayphotoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALa-b220i-XL electron spectrometer, Thermo Fisher ScientificK-Alpha, UK) under 300-W Al-Kα radiation. The magnetic properties were measured with a vibratingsample magnetometer (VSM), a physical property measurement system, at 300 K, as a function of theapplied magnetic field between −80 and 80 kOe. The ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) diffuse reflectancedata were collected with a UV–Vis spectrophotometer (Evolution 201, Thermo Scientific) equippedwith an integrated sphere.2.4. Evaluation of Catalytic PerformanceThe catalytic reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) using NaBH4 was chosen as the model reactionfor investigating the catalytic performance of magnetic carbon-doped CuO/Fe3O4 nanocompositecatalysts. Typically, catalytic reduction of a 30-mL 4-NP solution (1 mmol/L) was carried out in a beaker(100 mL) by continuously stirring at room temperature. Upon the addition of NaBH4 (10 mM) into the4-NP solution, its color changed immediately from light yellow to dark yellow due to the formationof 4-nitrophenolate ions (formed from the high alkalinity of NaBH4) [37]. Then, the dark-yellowcolor faded with time (due to the conversion of 4-NP to 4-aminophenol (4-AP)) after the addition ofcarbon-doped CuO/Fe3O4 nanocomposite catalyst (5 mg) (Scheme 1). UV–Vis adsorption spectrawere recorded using a UV–Vis spectrophotometer in the range of 250–550 nm. When the reactioncompleted, the catalyst was easily separated from the solution using an external magnet due to itsgood magnetic performance.69Nanomaterials 2019, 9, 277Scheme 1. Catalytic reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol.During the degradation process of organic dyes, 30 mL of dye solution (10 mg/L) and NaBH4(10 mM) were mixed in a beaker (100 mL) by continuously stirring at room temperature. Then, 5 mg ofcarbon-doped CuO/Fe3O4 nanocomposite catalyst was added to the reaction system, and the catalyticprocess was monitored using the UV–Vis spectrophotometer. When the reaction ended, the catalystwas readily separated from the solution using an external magnet.3. Results and Discussion3.1. Structure and Morphological CharacterizationMOFs can be readily converted to metal-oxide composites, which take advantage of their originalmorphology and porosity. The as-prepared HKUST-1, HKUST-1/Fe3O4, and HKUST-1/Fe3O4/CMFcomposite samples were then calcinated to obtain the nanoporous metal-oxide particles, generatingnanoporous CuO, CuO/Fe3O4, and carbon-doped CuO/Fe3O4 composite catalysts, respectively.Pyrolysis/thermolysis of HKUST-1/Fe3O4/CMF composites led to the formation of porouscarbon-doped CuO/Fe3O4 composites.The size and the morphology of the synthesized materials were investigated using a transmissionelectron microscope (TEM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). Figure 1 shows the SEM andTEM images of HKUST-1/Fe3O4/CMF composites and carbon-doped CuO/Fe3O4 composites aftercalcination in air. HKUST-1 crystals and Fe3O4 nanoparticles were uniformly loaded onto the surfaceof CMF (Figure 1). The nanocellulose MOF-derived porous carbon-doped CuO/Fe3O4 composite wasthen obtained through a calcination process under air at 500 ◦C for 5 h. The Brunauer–Emmett–Tellersurface area (SBET) of the carbon-doped CuO/Fe3O4 sample was 38.7 m2/g, which was much higherthan that of the CuO/Fe3O4 sample (0.042 m2/g) obtained from the calcination of HKUST-1/Fe3O4.The resultant carbon-doped CuO/Fe3O4 composite inherited largely the original porous morphologyof HKUST-1. Based on the mapping images, the conclusion was that both Cu and Fe elements dispersedwell in the carbon-doped CuO/Fe3O4 composite catalyst.XPS analysis was employed to investigate the elemental composition on the surface of differentcomposites. For the XPS spectrum of carbon-doped CuO/Fe3O4 composite catalyst (Figure 2a),the main peaks were C1s, O1s, Fe2p, and Cu2p, centered at around 285 eV, 530 eV, 720 eV, and 930 eV,respectively. The C1s XPS pattern of the sample is shown in Figure 2b. The spectrum contains two peaksat 285 eV and 288.5 eV, which may be attributed to carbon (sp2 hybridization) in the sample, and theCu–O–C bonds or Fe–O–C bonds, respectively. Figure 2c shows the Cu2p core-level XPS spectrum ofthe composite catalyst. The Cu2p1 and Cu2p3 binding energies for the composite catalyst were 952.8and 932.7 eV, respectively, indicating the presence of CuO in the composite catalyst. Similar resultswere reported in the literature [38,39]. The Fe2p3 and Fe2p1 binding energies (Figure 2d) for thecomposite catalyst were 710.7 and 725.4 eV, respectively, which agrees with published results [35,40],confirming the presence of Fe3O4 in the composite catalyst.70Nanomaterials 2019, 9, 277 Figure 1.

(d) High-resolution XPS scans over Fe2p peaks ofcarbon-doped CuO/Fe3O4 composite catalysts.71Nanomaterials 2019, 9, 277The crystalline nature and the composition of the as-synthesized products were characterizedusing PXRD. The crystalline phases of CuO, such as (110), (11-1), (111), (20-2), (020), (202), (11-3), (31-1),and (220) are shown in Figure 3a, which are consistent with those reported in the literature [41,42].These results support the conclusion that HKUST-1 was transformed into CuO via calcination underthe present conditions. In the XRD pattern of carbon-doped CuO/Fe3O4 composite, the diffractionpeaks and relative intensities were indexed to Fe3O4 (JCPD NO. 19-0629) and CuO (JCPD NO. 05-0661).This indicates that CuO and Fe3O4 were both obtained via calcining HKUST-1/Fe3O4/CMF compositesunder air. No other C-related impurity peaks were detected; a similar result was reported in theprevious research [43].Figure 3. (a) Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of carbon-doped Fe3O4/CuO compositecatalyst. (b) Magnetization curve at 300 K of carbon-doped Fe3O4/CuO composite catalyst.The magnetic behavior of the carbon-doped Fe3O4/CuO composite catalyst sample was evaluatedat 300 K. Its magnetization saturation value (Ms) was 15.1 emu·g−1, suggesting a good magneticproperty (Figure 3b). Thus, the magnetic carbon-doped Fe3O4/CuO composite catalyst could bereadily separated from the reaction system using a magnet for the recycling process.3.2. Catalytic ReductionIn this study, we investigated the application of carbon-doped CuO/Fe3O4 composite catalystsfor the catalytic reduction of 4-nitrophenol. In Figure 4a, the results are shown for the catalyticreduction of 4-NP to 4-AP in the presence of NaBH4 and carbon-doped CuO/Fe3O4 compositecatalysts. The reduction process was followed based on the UV–Vis spectrophotometry. It shows thatthe absorbance at 400 nm (4-NP) decreased gradually as a function of time, while the absorbance at290 nm (due to 4-AP) increased, confirming the catalytic reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP [44]. The catalyticreduction was almost complete within 10 min at room temperature, and the color of the solutionchanged from yellow to colorless. Similar results were also reported in the literature; Bordbar et al. [45]found that, using CuO/ZnO nanocomposites, catalytic reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP (using NaBH4 as thereducing agent) was completed in several minutes.The kinetics of calcined CMF, CuO, CuO/Fe3O4, and carbon-doped CuO/Fe3O4 compositesare shown in Figure 4b. In the absence of catalyst, the reduction of 4-NP by NaBH4 was negligible.In each case, the pseudo-first-order kinetic prevailed. The calcined CMF also had a negligible effect onthe reduction of 4-NP. The rate constants (k) for CuO, CuO/Fe3O4, and carbon-doped CuO/Fe3O4composite samples were 1.3 × 10−3 s−1, 3.6 × 10−3 s−1 and 6.5 × 10−3 s−1, respectively. In the caseof CuO, the catalytic activity was the lowest due to the aggregation of CuO nanoparticles, while thecatalytic efficiency of carbon-doped CuO/Fe3O4 composites was much better than that of CuO/Fe3O4,demonstrating that carbon doping is effective for enhancing the catalytic activity of the catalysts.The catalytic reduction of 4-NP by NaBH4 using metal-oxide nanoparticles (CuO) hastwo steps [46]: (1) borohydride ions are adsorbed onto the nanoparticle surface, forming active72Nanomaterials 2019, 9, 277surface-hydrogen, while 4-NP is also adsorbed onto the nanoparticle surface; (2) active hydrogenattacks the positively charged nitrogen in the nitro group of 4-NP, followed by the addition of twohydrogen atoms, producing 4-AP.Figure 4.

As shown in Figure 5a, for cationic dye (methylene blue),in the presence of NaBH4 and carbon-doped CuO/Fe3O4 composite catalyst, the absorbance at 660 nm(MB) gradually decreased as a function of time; furthermore, the catalytic reduction was completedwithin 6 min at room temperature (the color of the solution was colorless).The results from methyl orange (an anionic dye) are shown in Figure 5c. Under otherwise thesame conditions, the color change (from orange to colorless) was slower than that for MB (Figure 5a,from blue to colorless). The pseudo-first-order rate law was also valid here (Figure 5d). For thecarbon-doped CuO/Fe3O4 composite catalyst, the rate constant (k) was 2.4 × 10−3 s−1 for MO, while itwas 12.9 × 10−3 s−1 for MB.We compared the catalytic performance of the carbon-doped CuO/Fe3O4 composite catalystfor the reduction of 4-NP, MB, and MO, with other related ones from the literature (Table 1).As shown, the carbon-doped CuO/Fe3O4 composite catalyst showed much improved results, and thepseudo-first-order rate constant (k) for the nanocomposite catalyst from the present study was indeedconsistently higher than that reported in the literature. The improved results may be attributed to theunique original morphologies associated with HKUST-1.Table 1.

In the present study, after the catalytic degradation experiments, the magneticcarbon-doped CuO/Fe3O4 composite catalyst was readily separated from the reaction system usingan external magnet. The used catalysts were collected, and rinsed with distilled water several times.After a thorough washing process, the recovered magnetic catalyst was reused in the subsequent runof catalytic reduction of 4-NP under identical conditions, and the same process was repeated fivetimes. The results are shown in Figure 6. The catalytic performance of the magnetic carbon-dopedCuO/Fe3O4 composite catalyst decreased only slightly (the 4-NP reduction ratio decreased from 100%to 96%) after five cycles. Similar results were obtained in the reuse/recycling experiments of theas-prepared magnetic carbon-doped CuO/Fe3O4 composite catalyst during the catalytic reduction ofMB and MO. Therefore, the as-prepared magnetic carbon-doped CuO/Fe3O4 composite catalyst is apromising system for practical applications.74Nanomaterials 2019, 9, 277Figure 6.

ConclusionsIn this study, a nano-cellulose/MOF-derived carbon-doped CuO/Fe3O4 composite catalystwas successfully fabricated through pyrolysis/thermolysis of the HKUST-1/Fe3O4/CMF composite.The resultant carbon-doped CuO/Fe3O4 composite catalyst took advantage of the original porousmorphology of HKUST-1; consequently, the carbon-doped CuO/Fe3O4 composite catalyst exhibitedhigh catalytic activity for the reduction of 4-NP and organic dyes (MB and MO). In addition,the carbon-doped CuO/Fe3O4 composite catalyst showed good reusability/recyclability afterfive cycles. Notably, this strategy can be extended to the preparation of other functionalMOF-based derivatives.Author Contributions: Conceptualization, H.L. and L.Z.; Methodology, H.L.; Software, H.L. and N.A.; Validation,N.A. and J.M.; Formal Analysis, H.L. and L.Z.; Investigation, H.L.; Resources, X.Z. and Y.N.; Data Curation, J.M.;Writing-Original Draft Preparation, H.L.; Writing-Review & Editing, X.Z. and Y.N.; Visualization, L.Z. and J.M.;Supervision, Y.N.; Project Administration, X.Z. and Y.N.; Funding Acquisition, X.Z. and Y.N.Funding: This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31570576), the financialsupport from the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Provincial University (16KJA220005), the Canada ResearchChairs program of the Government of Canada, the Postgraduate Research and Practice Innovation Program ofJiangsu Province (KYCX17_0835), the Doctorate Fellowship Foundation of Nanjing Forestry University, and thePriority Academic Program Development (PAPD) of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions.

Well-dispersed and uniformly distributedgraphene platelets within a polymer matrix, with strong interfacial bonding between the plateletsand the matrix, provided an optimal nanocomposite system for industrial interest. This studyreports on the reinforcement of high molecular weight multimodal-high-density polyethylenereinforced by a microwave-induced plasma graphene, using melt intercalation. The tailored processincluded designing a suitable screw configuration, paired with coordinating extruder conditionsand blending techniques. This enabled the polymer to sufficiently degrade, predominantly throughthermomechanical-degradation, as well as thermo-oxidative degradation, which subsequently createda suitable medium for the graphene sheets to disperse readily and distribute evenly within the polymermatrix. Different microscopy techniques were employed to prove the effectiveness. This was thenqualitatively assessed by Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, rheology, mechanical testing, densitymeasurements, thermal expansion, and thermogravimetric analysis, confirming both the originality aswell as the effectiveness of the process.Keywords: graphene; multimodal-high density polyethylene; melt extrusion; polymer;nanocomposite, polymer degradation; dispersion and distribution of graphene1. IntroductionMultimodal high-density polyethylene (HDPE) is an engineered thermoplastic semi-crystallinepolymer, which is widely used in automotive, films, pressure pipes and fittings, bottles, tubes,and cables jacketing [1–5]. It is a hybrid of at least two distinct polyethylene components, wherein eachconstituent has a different density and different molecular weight fractions [1–5]. This allows flexibility inengineering its microstructure to meet the desired balance of properties for concrete practical applications.Nevertheless, multimodal HDPE can be further improved, for example, with the addition of fillers orreinforcements, in order to overcome deficiencies in their mechanical or thermal properties [5–18]. It isfeasible that a substantial benefit could be attained by strengthening the multimodal-hydrophobicpolymers with graphene (g), deriving new and unique nanocomposite properties [5–22]. However,a proper dispersion and distribution of graphene platelets within the nonpolar polyolefin matrix is stillNanomaterials 2018, 8, 947; doi:10.3390/nano8110947 www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials79Nanomaterials 2018, 8, 947a major challenge [6,15–22]. Irreversible agglomerates are formed through the van der Waals forcesbetween the 2D-platelets, as the large surface area of the graphene platelets leads to the creationof interfacial regions, causing them to spontaneously restack themselves [4,6,15–21]. This createsdefects which behave as voids, introducing degradation into the polymer matrices. Though numerousmethods for producing polymer-graphene nanocomposites have recently emerged, each method islimited by its compatibility with only certain types of graphene and polymers, requiring chemicalmodifications on both constituents of the nanocomposite [6,15–21]. The fabrication techniques can alsoalter the pristineness of graphene by introducing structural defects on the graphene basal plane [15–22].In addition, the production utilizes large amounts of solvent and supplementary chemicals, which incurshigher costs, as well as raising environmental, health, and safety concerns [15–22].It is therefore the topic of this study to introduce a more cost-effective, optimal way offabricating a nanocomposite of high molecular weight multimodal-HDPE matrix, reinforced with abottom-up graphene. These polymers are indeed widely used in a long-term application in an extremeenvironment, which includes hydrostatic, thermal, and environmental stresses [5,21,23]. Herein wereport a novel method for the preparation of high-performance polymer-graphene nanocomposite(PE-g) via melt intercalation, using a co-rotating intermeshing twin-screw extruder. Depicted inFigure 1 is a simple schematic diagram of the fabrication method followed in the present study.In the present work, we attempted to degrade the polymer to a sufficient level, throughthermo-oxidative, as well as thermo-mechanical degradation during the melt extrusion process.This created a compatible medium for the graphene to disperse and distribute thoroughly within thepolymer matrix. The polymer is consequently able to interact physically or chemically with the residualoxygen functional groups at the graphene surface which contains almost 5% oxygens, or through the shortmolecules introduced by thermo-mechanical degradation, with defective sp3 functional group on eitherthe surface, or at the edge of the graphene sheets. Accordingly, a better stress transfer can potentially beachieved through the strong interfacial bonding created between graphene platelets and the polymermatrix. Achieving a thorough dispersion and distribution of graphene within the multimodal-HDPE,by melt intercalation, via co-rotating intermeshing twin-screw extruder, has never yet been reportedaccording to the authors’ knowledge. The results of this research provide greater insight into differentmelt intercalation factors, affecting the multimodal HDPE-graphene nanocomposite performance andcriterion for effectively producing the next generation of black multimodal-polyethylene compounds foruse in high-pressure pipes, automotive, and energy cable applications [5–21,23].Figure 1. Simple schematic representation of the method followed in the present study.Gol’dberg–Zaikov model represents the general reaction mechanisms of all the thermo-mechanicaland thermo-oxidative degradations that can occur during the melt extrusion of a polyethylene [24,25].R represents the side chain of any hydrocarbon functional groups, r is the very short side chain ofany hydrocarbon functional groups, MW is the molecular weight, denotes an active free radical site,and τ3/2 is the shear stress in x and y directions.80Nanomaterials 2018, 8, 9472. Experimental2.1. MaterialsUnstabilized high-density polyethylene powders, produced with Ziegler Natta catalyst viaproprietary Borstar process, (Borouge, United Arab Emirates), with a melt flow rate of about 7.5 g/10 min(190 ◦C, 21.6 kg), Mw = 280 kg/mole, Mn = 8.49 kg/mole, Mw/Mn = 33, and a density of 950 kg/m3were used in this study. The multimodal high-density polyethylene matrix used in the present study wasengineered specifically for nanocomposite applications. According to the production process technology,the melt flow rate (MFR) of the polymer gives an indication that the split MFR ratio between the reactorsis significantly high [1–4]. The antioxidants’ masterbatch containing Irganox 1010 and Irgafos 168 wereadded to the polymers at 0.5 wt.% for optimum stabilization during processing. Graphene was suppliedby the FGV Cambridge Nanosystems Ltd. (Cambridge, United Kingdom), with ≥95% carbon purity, bulkdensity of 0.0266 g/ml, thickness < 1.0 nm, and flake size range of 150–500 nm. Carbon Black powderwas provided by Orion Engineered Carbons GmbH (Frankfurt am Main, Germany), with ≥92 cc/100goil absorption number, ash content of 0.10%, sulphur content of 0.10%, tint strength of 103%, averageprimary particle size of 20 nm, and a density of 1.7-1.9 g/cm3 at 20 ◦C.2.2. Nanocomposite PreparationThe graphene-based multimodal-HDPE nanocomposites (PE-g) were prepared via melt intercalationusing a Coperion ZSK 18 twin extruder, with a screw diameter of 18 mm and a barrel length of 720 mm(L/D = 40). The screw rotation speed (rpm) was 600 min-1, barrel temperature profile was in the range of170-240 ◦C (see Figure 2), and feed rate was between 1-2 kg/hr. Both the graphene and dry polyethylenepowders were fed separately into the extruder via a spiral flow screw Brabender ISC-CM plus feeder.The nanofillers were fed at 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 wt.% loadings. In order to prevent the polymer fromsevere degradation, an antioxidant masterbatch was simultaneously added through a side feeder, withthe total loading of 0.5 wt.%. The extruded pellets were subsequently compression molded to about0.4 mm thickness, following ISO 293 under 5 MPa, at a temperature of 200 ºC. This was undertaken via acompression molding platen press (Dr. Collin P 400 M, Ebersberg, Germany), for an overall programmingcycle of 32 min, at a heating and cooling rate of 15 ºC/min. The specimens were successively conditionedat 23 ± 2 ◦C and 50 ± 5%, for at least 48 h, prior to being tested.A schematic of a modular twin-extrusion screw configuration used in the present study is givenin Figure 2. There are four main types of screw elements generally used in co-rotating twin screwextruders; forward and back flow convening elements (unboxed), kneading elements for dispersivemixing purposes (yellow and blue boxes), and toothed mixing elements for distributive mixingpurposes (orange box) [26–30]. The screw consisted of 30% of 2-flighted right-handed normal andwide kneading elements (yellow box), with a 45º staggering angle, 9% of 16-flighted right-handedmixing elements (orange box), 6.7% of the 2-flighted left-handed narrow kneading elements (blue box)distributed over each dispersive segment. These percentages were based on the ratio of the mixingelements length to the total length of the screw shaft (720 mm).81Nanomaterials 2018, 8, 947Figure 2. Modular extrusion screw configuration based upon individual barrel sections and screwelements. The color boxes show the position of the dispersive and distributive kneading elementsalong the screw shaft (length of 724 mm).Since graphene has the ability to shield the polymer from heating and becoming completely moltenby enhancing the thermal stability in the feeding and melting zones [17,29–33], the nanocompositeconstituents were simultaneously fed from separate feeders into the extruder to prevent grapheneplatelets from stabilizing around the multimodal-HDPE powders. A long dispersive segment wasincorporated in the melting zone to increase the fusion rate of the polymer prior to entering thehomogenization zone. The left-handed narrow kneading elements (blue boxes) were placed on eachdispersive segment to melt the polymer entirely in the melting zone, and increase the residence time ateach dispersive segment. It induces a distribution mixing rather than dispersive (shearing) mixing,especially as its pitch length is very narrow [26,27]. The two distributive elements (orange boxes)were placed between long dispersive segments in order to keep the nanocomposite constituents undercontinuous high-pressure, and to cause the dispersed (sheared) graphene sheets to instantaneously bepushed away. One of the distributive elements (orange box) was placed between left-handed narrowkneading elements to increase the residence time in a narrower axial length, at the beginning of thehomogenization zone, by generating a reverse flow with the use of advancing discs which tend tocompress the fluid. This modular assembly build enabled the polymer to degrade to a sufficient level inthe targeted zone, under combined elongation and shear forces, prior to entering the homogenizationzone. Resultantly, melting the polymer could be completed at the first kneading segment in the meltingzones, preventing the graphene platelets from moving smoothly and re-connecting together throughthe van der Waals’s interactions.2.3. Characterization2.3.1. Polarized Light Microscope (PLM)Optical microscopy analyses were conducted on ZIESS Axio scope.A1 HAL 100/HBO 100,operated with an AxioCam MRc 5 camera, and AxioVision software. Film samples were sectioned toa thickness of 15 μm, using a fully automated rotary microtome Leica RM2265 (Leica microsystems,Wetzlar, Germany).2.3.2. Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM)Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed using a Hitachi HT7700, at anaccelerating voltage of 120 kV. Film samples were cryo-sectioned to a thickness of ~80 nm at -125 ◦C,using a Leica EM UC7/FC7 Cryo-Ultra-microtome.82Nanomaterials 2018, 8, 9472.3.3. Density MeasurementDensity measurement was performed with an analytical balance, equipped with a densitymeasurement kit (Metter Toledo XP205, Zurich, Switzerland), following an ASTM D792-methodB, based on the Archimedes’ principle where the weight of the sample immersed in an n-dodecanefluid decreases by an amount equal to the displacement of the liquid weight.2.3.4. Raman SpectroscopyRaman measurements were carried out using Renishaw inVia confocal Raman microscope with633 nm and 532 nm lasers. With the exception of the deformation test, all the Raman data wascollected using He-Ne ion laser with a wavelength of 633 nm (red, 1.96 eV). However, an Nd-YAGlaser with a wavelength of 532 nm (green, 2.33 eV) was used to evaluate the stress-transfer alongthe interfacial surface between the polymer matrix and reinforcement. The dog-bone specimens,having been prepared for tensile testing, were deformed in a three-point bending rig. The strain (εf)was measured by calculating the deflection of the beam at the mid-span (δ), following the equationεf=6 δ t/L2, where t is the thickness of the beam specimen and L is the span between the supports [6].2.3.5. X-ray Diffraction (XRD)X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed using a Bruker D8-Advance diffractometerequipped with Cu Kα1 radiation (λ = 1.54060 Å). The diffraction patterns were recorded with a stepsize of 0.15087◦, and dwell time of 5s.2.3.6. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM)A scanning electron microscope (SEM) was utilized to assess the cryofractured cross-sectionsurface of the uncoated polymers, using an FEI QUANT 250 FEG SEM, at an accelerating voltage of2 kV. Samples were notched prior to being submerged in liquid nitrogen for ten minutes.2.3.7. Tensile TestingTensile properties of the nanocomposites such as tensile modulus, stress and strain at both yieldand break, as well as other aspects of the tensile stress-strain curve were studied on the stampedISO 527-2 dog-bone specimens, type 1B. This was achieved using die punch equipment (ElastoconEP 02, Sweden) on the compression molded samples. These were measured with the Zwick/RoellUniversal Testing Machine (UTM)–Z050, using a load cell of 2.5 kN, grip-to-grip separation of 115 mm,a gauge length of 50 mm, and a cross-head speed of 50 mm/min. A contact type extensometer (ZwickMultiXtense, Germany) was used to measure the strain of the specimen. The results were based on aminimum of 6 specimens.2.3.8. Thermomechanical Analyzer (TMA)Q400 Thermomechanical analyzer (TMA) was employed to determine the bending propertiesof the nanocomposites with dynamic mode through the 3-point bending test. Samples were cooledto −150 ◦C at the cooling rate of 3 ◦C/min for 10 min, and subsequently heated to 150 ◦C at theheating rate of 3 ◦C/min. The modulate force was 0.01 N at a frequency of 1 Hz in an ambientgas atmosphere (50 mL/min), using a wedge-shaped quartz probe. The dimension of the sampleswas 10 × 3.4 × 0.5 mm3. The same equipment was employed for studying the coefficient of thermalexpansion (CTE) via a flat-tipped standard expansion probe in an ambient gas atmosphere (50 mL/min).Flat samples with dimensions of 6 × 6 × 4 mm3 were heated at 3 ◦C/min from room temperatureto 100 ◦C. They were then held for 10 min, then cooled to 0 ◦C at the same rates of 3 ◦C/min,then held for 10 min, and subsequently heated at 3 ◦C/min to 120 ◦C, under a constant load of 0.05 N.The displacement was reset to zero at the start of the last sequence where the measurement started.83Nanomaterials 2018, 8, 9472.3.9. Rheology AnalysisSimple qualitative characterization related to an indirect measurement of molecular weight andprocessability of the polymer was studied upon the melt-flow rate (MFR). Pellets of 3-8 g were chargedinto a cylinder at 190 ◦C under the load of 21.6 kg, which was achieved using the Melt IndexerMI-4 manufactured by GÖETTFERT Werkstoff–Prüfmaschinen GmbH (Buchen, Germany), followingISO 1133 procedure B. The rheological behavior of the samples was studied using stress-controlledrotational rheometer, an Anton Paar Physica MCR 301 with CTD450 heating unit, at 190 ◦C under anitrogen atmosphere. The compression molded sample, weighing 1.5 g, 25 mm in diameter, and 1.5 mmthick was conditioned at 40 ◦C for 48 h. The sample was then placed onto a 25 mm parallel plate fixtureand trimmed to a thickness of 1.2 mm by slowly lowering the upper plate. Dynamic frequencysweep was conducted from 500 to 0.0154 rad/s at 5% strain. The reason for starting from themaximum frequency was to avoid sample degradation under high temperature and low angularspeed. The polydispersity index (PDI) was measured as follows [33]:PDI =100 000G′(ωCOP), ωCOP = ω(G′ = G′′)(1)where G’ is the storage shear modulus, G” is the loss shear modulus, ω is the angular frequency,and ωCOP is the crossover frequency obtained from the intersection of storage modulus and lossmodulus in a log-log scale of a frequency sweep test.2.3.10. Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA)Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out with Q500 TGA (TA instruments, New Castle,USA) with a heating rate of 10 ◦C /min from room temperature to 1000 ◦C in a nitrogen atmosphere.High-resolution (Hi-Res)-dynamic mode was performed with a sensitivity of 2.00 and a resolution of 4 ◦C.3. Results and DiscussionA twin-screw extrusion system with a modular screw configuration was utilized in this study tofabricate a polymer nanocomposite with well-dispersed and uniformly distributed graphene flakes.The screw configuration was optimized after several trials, starting with a screw design employed forcompounding such polymers with a high-volume fraction of nanoparticles (carbon black) or nanoclays(talc). A combination of different elements was utilized and arranged according to mixing requirementsand material properties to be attained [26–32]. A schematic of the optimal screw configuration for thestudied nanocomposite model is given in Figure 2.3.1. Morphology of Graphene Sheets in a Nanocomposite MatrixThe tailored process included designing a suitable screw configuration, paired with coordinatingextruder conditions and blending techniques. This subsequently created a suitable medium for thegraphene platelets to disperse readily, and distribute thoroughly within the multimodal-HDPE matrix,as demonstrated in Figure 3a,c. The mean particle size of the detected graphene particles and %areafraction (200 × 200 μm2) was around 0.5 μm2 and 0.0063, respectively. Graphene monolayers aretransparent under an optical microscope, opacity of 2.3 ± 0.1%, while the optical loss become greater inthe wrinkled and overlapped samples [34,35]. L. J. Cote et al. [35] found that the average light scatteringfrom the wrinkled region was about 3.7 times that of the overlapped areas. For the nanocompositeproduced using the pre-existing commercial approach, however, the mean particle size of the grapheneagglomerates was calculated to be 4.12 μm2, with maximum particle size of around 4.7 μm2, and a%area fraction of 79.4 (see Figure 3b,d). The %area fraction and mean particle size were calculatedbased on transmission electron microscope (TEM) and light microscopy analysis, graphene particlesof less than 0.05 μm2 or 500 nm were excluded from the calculations, i.e. the average lateral size84Nanomaterials 2018, 8, 947of graphene platelets ranges between 150–500 nm. A decrease in the %area fraction means a betterdistribution and fewer agglomerates.Figure 3. (a,b) Light microscopy images and (c,d) TEM images show the dispersion and distribution of1 wt.% loading of graphene platelets within the multimodal-HDPE matrix (PE-g-1%). Images for thesimilar nanocomposite produced by a pre-existing processing protocol (right), were compared withPE-g-1% produced in this study (left). The TEM and light microscopy images were taken at 10k and20x, respectively.3.2. Dispersion and Distribution of Graphene Platelets Within the Nananocomposite MatrixFigure 4a shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the neat multimodal-HDPE, graphenepowder, and PE-g-1% samples. The diffraction peak (002) appeared in the XRD pattern of grapheneat 2θ = 26.07◦ and exhibited a broad band with a corresponding d-spacing of 0.3414 nm (Bragg’slaw), and average thickness of 1.941 nm (Scherrer’s equation), whereas the weak diffraction peak(100) was observed at 2θ = 42.89◦ [36,37]. This indicates the sample flakes consisted of 5-6 graphenelayers, which is consistent with the TEM images shown in Figure S4. The weak intensity of these twocharacteristic diffraction peaks is due to the 2D nature of graphene, especially those with very fewlayers [38]. Interestingly, the XRD pattern of the PE-g-1% is similar to that of a neat multimodal-HDPEmatrix, only showing the crystalline diffraction peaks {(110) and 200)} of the neat multimodal-HDPEmatrix. Clearly the XRD results demonstrated that the graphene platelets almost exfoliated intoindividual sheets and dispersed well in the polymer matrix after the extrusion processing [36–42].85Nanomaterials 2018, 8, 947Figure 4. Dispersion and distribution of graphene platelets within the polymer matrix. (a) XRD patternsof the neat multimodal-HDPE, graphene powder, and PE-g-1%. (b) Overlaid Raman spectrum of theneat multimodal-HDPE, graphene powder, and PE-g-1%. The measured 2D Raman bands with 1.96 eVlaser energy of graphene (I) and PE-g-1% (II) are fitted with four and five Lorentzians, respectively.(c) Density measurement of graphene/multimodal-HDPE (PE-g), and carbon black/multimodal-HDPE(PE-CB) nanocomposites as a function of nanofiller loading (0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 wt.%).Overlay Raman spectra of the neat multimodal-HDPE, graphene powder, and PE-g-1% samples,are shown in Figure 4b. The three intense peaks appeared in the Raman spectra of graphene at1327 cm−1, 1577.5 cm−1, and 2646 cm−1, representing the characteristic D-band, G-band, and 2D-bandpeaks, respectively [43–45]. The G-band arises from the bond stretching of the sp2 carbon atoms(chains or rings), while the breathing modes of the sp2 carbon atoms in a hexagon ring gives rise tothe D-band [43–45]. The D-band, therefore, requires a defect to be activated (by disorder or at theedge) [43–45]. It originates from one iTO phonon mode around the K point by double resonance,whereas the overtone of the D’ and D-bands gives rise to 2D’ and 2D-bands [43–45]. The 2D (or 2D’)peak does not require a defect for its activation, because it originates from the two iTO phononswith opposite momentum near Brillouin zone [43–45]. The position, full width at high maximum(FWHM), intensity ratio (I2D/IG), and Lorentzian fittings of the 2D peak provide good correlation withthe number of layers of graphene in a flake sample [43–47]. In Figure 4bI, the 2D-band of graphenesample is fitted by five Lorentzians, with an overall FWHM of 65.52 cm−1. Z. Lin et al. [46] andE. Dervishi et al. [47] in fact used up to five Lorentzian peaks to fit the 2D-band of their few-layergraphene produced by a bottom up approach. For PE-g-1%, the three prominent characteristic D, G,and 2D peaks associated with graphene were observed at 1327 cm−1, 1582.5 cm−1, and 2658 cm−1,respectively. The 2D-band of the nanocomposite shown in Figure 4bII, is red-shifted from 2646 cm−1 to2658 cm−1, fitted by four Lorentzians, with an overall FWHM decreased from 65.52 cm−1 to ~53 cm−1.Four fitted Lorentzians, each with a FWHM of ~24 cm−1, most likely arose from the asymmetry betweenthe valence and conduction bands present in the bilayer graphene [43–47]. Besides, the increase of the(I2D/IG) from 0.98 for graphene to 1.55 for PE-g-1%, reveals the reduction of the graphene layers [43].86Nanomaterials 2018, 8, 947Overall, these results indicate that the graphene platelets are indeed dispersed (thinned) through themelt extrusion process.Figure 4c depicts the density (ρc) of the graphene/multimodal-HDPE (PE-g) and carbonblack/multimodal-HDPE (PE-CB) nanocomposites at nanofiller loadings of 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 wt.%.The PE-CB sample is a commercial grade, produced based on the same polymer matrix, but reinforcedby a carbon black with a density of 1700-1900 kg·m−3. A monolayer graphene is made up ofcovalently-bonded sp2-hybridised carbon atoms, densely packed in a honeycomb lattice [21,22].Therefore, the density of a defect-free monolayer graphene, with a thickness of 0.142 nm, is estimatedto be around 2175 kg·m−3 [48]. On the other hand, carbon black is composed of primary particlesthat are permanently fused together through the covalent bonds, into an aggregate structure [49].Each primary particle is made up of imperfect crystallites of turbostratic graphite structure, whichare twisted into each other throughout the aggregates [49]. Accordingly, the graphene used in thisstudy is likely to have a density closer to the carbon black density than a monolayer graphene, i.e.,defective surface structure through the oxygen-containing functional groups (see SupplementaryMaterials Figure S3). As is evident from Figure 4c, the density of the multimodal-HDPE matrix(ρm = 950 kg·m−3) increased linearly with the addition of the nanofillers, i.e., densities of bothnanocomposites increased by the same amount. The slope values are calculated at 4.003 for PE-g and4.093 for PE-CB, suggesting that the graphene platelets were homogenously dispersed and distributedthroughout the polymer matrix. An increase in the nanocomposite density is attributed to the highdensity of the reinforcements (ρr) employed to reinforce the polymer matrix, according to the equationof the form (ρc = 1/(Wr/ρr) + (Wm/]ρm)), where Wr and Wm are the weight fractions of reinforcementand matrix, respectively [4]. With a greater incorporation of high-density reinforcement, a highernanocomposite density is obtained. In the case of agglomeration however, most of the grapheneplatelets will be lost in the accumulation, thereby the increase in the nanocomposite density remainsrelatively small.3.3. Interfacial Adhesion Strength between Graphene and Polymer MatrixThe interfacial adhesion strength between graphene sheets and a polymer matrix can be exploredthrough the microscopic examination of cryofractured cross-sectional surfaces. Shown in Figure 5a isa SEM image of the neat multimodal-HDPE surface exposed by cryofracture. The SEM micrographexhibits fibrils with various extents of surface fibrillation in the draw direction. The occurrence offibrils may suggest that the fracture was due to chain slippage or scission in crystalline (long fibrils)and amorphous (short fibrils) regions [50]. Contrastingly, graphene was shown to have a significanteffect on the microstructure of the adjacent polymer as evident by changes to the fibrous morphologyof the PE-g-1% shown in Figure 5b. The SEM micrograph of the nanocomposite exhibits a number ofgraphene platelets protruding out of the fracture surface of the polymer matrix, i.e. embedded andstrongly tied to the matrix.These flakes are well dispersed and evenly distributed within the multimodal-HDPE matrix,which may have formed a continually interconnected network structure throughout the matrix [50–54].Interestingly, the fractured surface of the nanocomposite become rough, compared to that of theunfilled multimodal-HDPE. Conceptually, the fracture toughness is quantified by the amount ofthe energy absorbed per unit crack extension [52]. Therefore, the significant change in the breaking(crack propagation) mechanism accordingly suggests that the strong interfacial bonding between thepolymer matrix and graphene platelets likely split the material into cavities and molecular bundlesunder large loading [50]. The facilitated stress transfer along the large interfacial area betweenthe reinforcement and matrix is expected to potentially display mechanical reinforcement [50–53].In Figure 5c, the storage modulus measured by dynamic thermomechanical analysis (DTMA) increasedby 75%, 84%, and 118% at -100 ◦C, -50 ◦C, and 23.5 ◦C, respectively. The tensile modulus increasedby ≥35%, from 835 ± 13 MPa for neat multimodal-HDPE, to 1135 ± 17 MPa for PE-g-1%, as shownin Figure 5d. Moreover, the maximum tensile strain increased by 11%, from 615 ± 43 % for neat87Nanomaterials 2018, 8, 947multimodal (extruded), to 680 ± 31% for the PE-g-1%. This increase in the tensile strain was possiblypreceded by a prolonged exposure of the neat polymer to a high temperature in the extruder, under acombined high shear and elongation forces [55]. Thus, graphene has most likely acted as an antioxidantand protected the polymer from excessive thermo-oxidative degradation [55,56]. The maximum tensilestrain of the nanocomposite is therefore compared to a non-extruded multimodal-HDPE for verification.Interestingly, the tensile strain decreased from >800% for neat multimodal-HDPE (non-extruded) toonly 680 ± 31% for the PE-g-1%. This latter subject will be discussed in greater detail later in this study.Nevertheless, this indicates that graphene reinforced the polymer through the heat transfer from thepolymer matrix to graphene platelets along the interface.Figure 5. Assessment of the interfacial adhesion strength between graphene sheets and polymer matrix.SEM images of a cross-section fracture surface from (a) neat multimodal-HDPE and (b) PE-g-1%. (c)Dynamic-thermomechanical analysis (DTMA) of the neat multimodal-HDPE and PE-g-1%. (d) Tensilestress-strain curves for the pristine multimodal-HDPE (non-extruded), neat multimodal-HDPE(extruded), and PE-g-1%. The pristine polymer is the powder polyethylene. (e) Shift with strainof the 2D and G Raman bands of the graphene during deformation upon PE-g-1% nanocomposite(laser excitation energy 2.33 eV). The corresponding 2D and G Raman shifts as a function of appliedstrain are shown in the two graphs on the right.The interfacial adhesion strength between the polymer matrix and graphene platelets wasfurther investigated by the stress-induced Raman band shifts [57–60]. In Figure 5e, the 2D andG Raman bands of graphene in a nanocomposite shifted to higher wavenumbers as a function ofapplied strain, suggesting that the graphene platelets went into biaxial compression as reported in theliterature [57,58]. Beyond ~9% strain however, these two bands reverted closer to that of the unstrainedpeak positions, due to relaxation of the graphene sheets upon debonding between the nanocompositeconstituents [57–60]. The 2D and G Raman bands have significantly downshifted after ~9% strain,by ~34 cm−1 and 28 cm−1, respectively. Surprisingly, the 9% strain is around the yield point as can be88Nanomaterials 2018, 8, 947seen in the stress-strain curve shown in Figure 5d. Overall, the results show that a strong interfacialbonding is created between graphene sheets and polymer matrix [57–60].3.4. Rheology and Thermal Stability Performance of a NanocompositeFigure 6a-b shows the rheological behaviour of neat multimodal-HDPE and PE-g-1%. Shown inFigure 6a is the pseudoplastic, non-Newtonian behavior of the viscoelastic polymer. The influenceof graphene on the viscoelastic response of the polymer is revealed from the change in the absolutevalues of the storage (G’) and loss (G”) moduli, as well as their frequency dependence [33,61].Figure 6. Thermal stability performance and rheological behaviors. (a) Dynamic frequency sweepmeasurements performed at 190 ◦C. ωC is the crossover frequency point and GC is the crossovermodulus point in a log–log scale. (b) Melt flow rate (MFR) measurements of PE-g nanocomposites as afunction of graphene loading (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 wt.%). (c) Thermogravimetric thermogramsperformed in N2 atmosphere. (d) Dimensional change as a function of temperature. (e) Coefficient ofthermal expansion (CTE) measured at temperature difference range of 30-105 ◦C.At a high-shear rate, both materials exhibited thinning behavior, which resulted in a decrease ofextensional viscosity. However, the incorporation of 1 wt.% graphene increased the melt viscosity ofthe nanocomposite, though the relative increase gradually lessened at high-shear rate. The presenceof graphene has considerably increased the pseudoplasticity at a low shear rate region. At theangular frequency (ω) of 0.0154 rad/s, the complex viscosity increased from 0.13 MPa·s for neatmultimodal-HDPE to 0.24 MPa·s for the PE-g-1%. Furthermore, the loss and storage moduli of theneat polymer increased by a value of 92% and 77% with 1 wt.% loading of graphene, respectively.The greater amount of storage and loss moduli of PE-g-1% suggests that the formation of a stronginterfacial bonding between the polymer matrix and the high-modulus graphene reduced the losstangent, the nanocomposite accordingly became more elastic [33,61–63]. This is in addition to thethorough dispersion and distribution of the nanofillers, which led to a decrease in the degree of thechain mobility of the polymers, and thus suppressed the shear flow of the polyethylene macromolecularchains [4]. In addition, the crossover modulus point (GC) and crossover frequency point (ωC) havedecreased from 0.044 MPa·s and 4.5 rad/s for the neat multimodal-HDPE to 0.035 MPa·s and 1.2 rad/s89Nanomaterials 2018, 8, 947for PE-g-1%, respectively. The shift of ωC to lower region indicates that the nanocomposite exhibitedhigher average molecular mass and/or the entangled molecules were induced by the three-dimensionalnetwork of graphene platelets within the matrix [33]. However, the GC shifting to lower values afterthe reinforcement indicates that the polymer exhibited broader molecular weight distribution, which isevident from the increase in the polydispersity index (PDI) by 18.4%, i.e. the larger the PDI, the broaderthe molecular weight distribution [33]. The shift of Gc upon the addition of the reinforcement possiblyarose also from exposing the neat polymer to high temperature, under a combination of high shearand elongation forces, for a prolonged period of time. In Figure 6b, the melt flow rate (MFR) of theextruded multimodal-HDPE decreased gradually from 13.6 g/min to only 6.42 g/min with 1 wt.%graphene loading at 21.6 kg/190 ◦C, whilst the MFR of the pristine multimodal-HDPE (non-extruded)was only was only 7.5 g/min. The lower the MFR, the higher the molecular weight or the viscosity.This indicates that graphene acted as a thermal barrier and enhanced the thermal stability of thepolymer through the strong interface bonding.The synergistic effect advantages of graphene are further investigated by thermal expansion andthermogravimetric analyses (TGA). As shown from the TGA thermograms in Figure 6c, the onsetdegradation temperature of PE-g-1% increased significantly by more 31 ◦C. The onset temperatureat 5% mass loss (T5%) of neat multimodal-HDPE increased from 405 ◦C to 434.2 ◦C upon 1 wt.%loading of graphene (see Table 1). The reinforced polymers exhibited a greater melt strength duringthermoforming such that the sagging resistance of the nanocomposite has been improved. The largeaspect ratio of graphene with a platelet structure likely offered a larger interfacial surface withthe polymer matrix which in turn slowed the diffusion of the decomposition products from acontinuous network-structured protective layer created in the nanocomposite. It would seem asthough graphene acted as an antioxidant and consequently protected the polymer from excessivethermal degradation [64–69]. The polymer could therefore be extruded in aggressive conditions,for example with a screw configuration of 37% of dispersive elements at a very low feed rate. Thisalso implies that the amount of thermo-mechanical and thermo-oxidative degradations achieved wassufficient enough to produce an efficient reinforcement. This was achieved through the formation ofa strong interfacial adhesion bond between the polymer matrix and graphene platelets, which hasaccordingly enhanced the thermal stability of the polymer.Table 1. TGA data of the neat multimodal-HDPE and its nanocomposite.Sample Tonset, (◦C) T5%, (◦C) T30%, (◦C) T50%, (◦C) T80%, (◦C)Neat multimodal-HDPE 400 405 406.8 409 419.3PE-g-1% 433.4 435 437 437 437.2T5%, T30%, T50%, and T80%, are the onset temperatures at 5%, 30%, 50%, and 80% mass loss, respectively.The coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the PE-g-1% was calculated to be 0.55 × 10−6 ◦C−1over the temperature range of 30–103 ◦C, as shown in Figure 6d-e. The CTE started to becomepositive after 100 ◦C confirming that graphene sheets were well bonded with the polymer matrix, andsuggests the continuous interconnected network structure formed in the polymer matrix hinderedthe reorientation of the polymer chains. Mounet et al. [70], Zakharchenko et al. [71], Yoon et al. [72],Bao et al. [73], and others found that graphene has negative thermal expansion at low temperatures.Mounet et al. [70] used a first-principles calculation, and estimated the CTE of graphene remainsnegative up to 2500 K. Zakharchenko et al. [71] found that the transition from negative to positiveCTE occurs at ~900 K. The CTE of a single-layer graphene measured by Yoon et al. [72] viatemperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy remained negative in the temperature range of 200–400 K.Therefore, it is not yet clear at what exact point the CTE changes from negative to positive.90Nanomaterials 2018, 8, 9474. ConclusionsA high-performance novel graphene-based multimodal polyethylene nanocomposite wasproduced directly without any particular treatment to the composite constituents. Differentcharacterization techniques such as TEM, SEM, optical microscopes, Raman spectroscopy, Rheology,density measurements, TGA, and CTE were employed in order to demonstrate the novelty ofthe fabrication method. Microscopic analysis showed that graphene platelets were homogenouslydispersed and distributed within the polymer matrix. The electronic and optical microscopies showedthat the graphene was dispersed with an average size of less than 450 nm, and distributed with a%area fraction of only 0.0063. The adhesion strength between the graphene sheets and polymer matrixexamined by microscopic examination of the cryofractured surfaces of the nanocomposite, mechanicaltesting and stress-induced Raman band shifts, revealed a strong interfacial bonding attained throughthermo-mechanical and thermo-oxidative degradation to a controlled level during the melt extrusionprocess. The cryofractured surface of the nanocomposite became rough with fibrils almost entirelyabsent. Deflection of the nanocomposite led the characteristic 2D and G Raman peaks of graphene toshift significantly towards high wavenumbers. This was confirmed further by the mechanical testingwhere the storage modulus of the polyethylene reinforced with 1 wt.% of graphene increased up to118% at room temperature.The thermal performance of the nanocomposite was investigated via rheology testing, TGA andthermal expansion analysis. Loading a polymer with 1 wt.% graphene has resulted in a significant shiftof the crossover frequency point and crossover modulus point to the lower regions. The homogenousdispersion and distribution of graphene platelets within the polymer matrix, as well as the strongadhesion bonding, led to the formation of an interconnected 3D network in the polymer whichaccordingly restricted the movement and expansion of the polymer chains movements. This hasresulted in a significant increase in the onset degradation temperature by more 31 ◦C as a consequenceof a thermal barrier or synergetic effects induced by graphene. The nanocomposites exhibited almostzero thermal expansion below 100 ◦C. The results of this study change the idea of there being difficultyin using melt extrusion for producing well dispersed and disturbed graphene-based hydrophobicpolymer nanocomposites. Furthermore, considering there is no need to chemically treat grapheneor polymer, or in fact change anything in the existing plants, such a result can significantly attractthe industry.Supplementary Materials: The following are available online at http://www.mdpi.com/2079-4991/8/11/947/s1,Figure S1: Type and use of each element used in the present study, Figure S2: The cross-sectional area of atwo-flighted screw element, Figure S3: XPS wide range spectrum of graphene powder (CAE=50eV).

The copolymerization of N,N-dimethylacrylamide (DMA) ontothe gum tragacanth (GT) was carried out to develop gum tragacanth-cl-N,N-dimethylacrylamide(GT-cl-poly(DMA)) hydrogel using N,N’-methylenebisacrylamide (NMBA) and potassium persulfate(KPS) as cross-linker and initiator correspondingly. The various GT-cl-poly(DMA) hydrogelsynthesis parameters were optimized to achieve maximum swelling of GT-cl-poly(DMA)hydrogel. The optimized GT-cl-poly(DMA) hydrogel was then filled with RGO to form reducedgraphene oxide incorporated gum tragacanth-cl-N,N-dimethylacrylamide (GT-cl-poly(DMA)/RGO)hydrogel composite. The synthesized samples were used for competent adsorption ofHg2+ and Cr6+ ions. Fourier transform infrared, X-ray powder diffraction, field emissionscanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy were used to characterizethe gum tragacanth-cl-N,N-dimethylacrylamide hydrogel and reduced graphene oxideincorporated gum tragacanth-cl-N,N-dimethylacrylamide hydrogel composite. The experiments ofadsorption-desorption cycles for Hg2+ and Cr6+ ions were carried out to perform the reusability ofgum tragacanth-cl-N,N-dimethylacrylamide hydrogel and reduced graphene oxide incorporatedgum tragacanth-cl-N,N-dimethylacrylamide hydrogel composite. From these two samples, reducedgraphene oxide incorporated gum tragacanth-cl-N,N-dimethylacrylamide exhibited high adsorptionability. The Hg2+ and Cr6+ ions adsorption by gum tragacanth-cl-N,N-dimethylacrylamide andreduced graphene oxide incorporated gum tragacanth-cl-N,N-dimethylacrylamide were best suitedfor pseudo-second-order kinetics and Langmuir isotherm. The reported maximum Hg2+ and Cr6+ions adsorption capacities were 666.6 mg g-1 and 473.9 mg g-1 respectively.Keywords: reduced graphene oxide; gum tragacanth; hydrogel; hydrogel composite; mercury ion;chromium ion; reusabilityNanomaterials 2020, 10, 1616; doi:10.3390/nano10081616 www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials95Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 16161. IntroductionContinuous industrialization leads to the excessive release of toxic pollutants into various sourcesof water. The heavy metal poisoning of water has now become a pandemic concern due to its dangerousimpacts to human health because these pollutants are non-degradable, poisonous, cancer-causing agentand are hard to separate from water [1]. For metal uptake from water, several approaches have beenestablished, among them, treatment via adsorption is the most appealing one. Adsorption technologyis widely used for removing pollutants due to its simple operation, cost and easy implementation [2].Specifically, hydrogels based on biopolymer have now become very useful in adsorptive wastewatertreatment [3]. Gum tragacanth based hydrogel is highly adsorptive because of the presence of hydroxyl(–OH) and carboxyl (–COOH) groups [4,5]. It is a renewable, cost-effective and environmentallyfriendly polysaccharide that can be easily polymerized to form cross-linked structures [6–8].Gum tragacanth is commonly found in the sap of different legumes in the Middle East.The biological source of gum tragacanth is a plant named Astragalus gummifer. It is a complexmixture of polysaccharides including bassorin and tragacanthin units. When mixed with water,gum tragacanth produces a colloidal hydrosol. The bassorin unit can (composed of 60–70% of thecompound) swells to form a gel [9]. Mallakpour et al. reported the glutaraldehyde cross-linkedgum tragacanth/CaCO3 hydrogel composite as an adsorbent for the abstraction of Pb2+ ion [10].Moghaddam et al. synthesized methoxyl gum tragacanth-glutamic acid/polyacrylamide hydrogel viaelectron beam radiations as an adsorbent for trapping uranium ions from toxic uranium solution [11].The adsorption and stability of hydrogel can be improved by using reduced graphene oxide as fillerin the hydrogel matrix. Reduced graphene oxide (RGO) can result in high C/O with better mechanicalstrength [12]. The reduced graphene oxide is partially decorated with an oxygen-rich functional groupthat acts as active sites for interaction. The high RGO surface, large porosity and defect sites arethe features that help pollutants adsorption [13]. Sahraei et al. reported adsorption of Cr6+ metalusing chitosan/reduced-graphene oxide/montmorillonite composite hydrogel. The composite hydrogelshowed maximum Cr6+ absorption of 87.03 mg g−1 [14]. Zhuang et al. synthesized molybdenumdisulfide/RGO hydrogel as an adsorbent for mercury ions removal [15].The synthesized gum tragacanth-cl-N,N-dimethylacrylamide (GT-cl-poly(DMA)) and reducedgraphene oxide incorporated gum tragacanth-cl-N,N-dimethylacrylamide (GT-cl-poly(DMA)/RGO)hydrogel composite were efficient in adsorption of Hg2+ and Cr6+ as compared to previously reportedadsorbents in the literature (Table 1 ). This was due to the perfect combination of reduced grapheneoxide (RGO), gum tragacanth (GT), and N,N-dimethylacrylamide (DMA) led to the presence ofmany –OH, –NH2 and –COOH hydrophilic groups. The gum tragacanth-cl-N,N-dimethylacrylamidehydrogel and reduced graphene oxide incorporated gum tragacanth-cl-N,N-dimethylacrylamidehydrogel composite exhibited the highest removal capacity of 625 mg g−1 and 666.6 mg g−1 respectivelyfor Hg2+. Similarly, for Cr6+, removal capacities were 401.6 mg g−1 and 473.9 mg g−1 respectively.The previously reported works (Table 1) have not comprehensively considered the factorsresponsible for the high adsorption capability of the adsorbent. In this work, we achieved a betteradsorption capacity of 666.6 mg g−1 and 473.9 mg g−1 for mercury and chromium ions withinless time using a low adsorbent dose. Specifically, prepared reduced graphene oxide incorporatedgum tragacanth cross-linked poly N,N-dimethylacrylamide hydrogel composite shows a very highadsorption percentage of 99% for mercury metal ion under optimal conditions (adsorbent dose= 0.035 gand time = 270 min, T = 25 ◦C, the concentration of mercury solution = 20 ppm) which means it ishighly efficient for mercury adsorption. Also, compared to recently reported studies, we are able tosynthesize our adsorbents in very short period (90 s) with high swelling percentage (Table 2) usingmicrowave radiations. This is one of the key points where our synthesis part shows novelty. Hence,we developed the simple and fast synthetic route for the preparation of efficient, sustainable andeco-friendly graphene oxide incorporated gum tragacanth-cl-N,N-dimethylacrylamide hydrogel withhigh adsorption rate for heavy metal ions.96Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 1616Table 1.

GT-cl-poly(DMA)/RGOhydrogel compositeMicrowaveassistedmethod90 s 971.9% Present workIn this work, we developed first-time gum tragacanth-cl-N,N-dimethylacrylamide hydrogel andreduced graphene oxide incorporated gum tragacanth-cl-N,N-dimethylacrylamide hydrogel compositefor adsorption of Hg2+ and Cr6+. The RGO was synthesized from graphite and incorporated inGT-cl-poly(DMA) hydrogel matrix to increase the adsorption efficiency. The sorption study wasexplained by kinetic and isotherm models. The effect of pH, adsorbent dose and RGO loadingon adsorption were performed. The gum tragacanth-cl-N,N-dimethylacrylamide hydrogel wassystematically designed based on swelling. The adsorbed samples were desorbed successfully byusing 0.1 M HNO3 and used further for adsorption experiments.97Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 16162. Materials and Methods2.1. MaterialsGum tragacanth (GT), (molecular weight = 8.4 × 105 g mol−1), potassium persulfate (KPS),N,N’-methylenebisacrylamide (NMBA), N,N-dimethylacrylamide (DMA) were purchased fromSigma-Aldrich (Sigma Aldrich Chemicals Pvt. Ltd., Delhi, India). Graphite powder, H3PO4, KMnO4,H2O2 and concentrated H2SO4 (98 wt %) were obtained from LOBA-Chemie (Loba Chemie Pvt. Ltd.,Tarapur, Maharashtra, India). Hg2+ and Cr6+ ions solutions were obtained by dissolving mercurychloride (Sigma Aldrich Chemicals Pvt. Ltd., Delhi, India) and potassium chromate (Sigma AldrichChemicals Pvt. Ltd., Delhi, India) reagents in distilled water.2.2. Synthesis of Reduced Graphene Oxide (RGO)For the synthesis, a mixture of 50 mL concentrated H2SO4 and 5.5 mL of H3PO4 was taken in abeaker. Then, 1.0 g of graphite powder and KMnO4 (4.0 g) were added to the mixture after maintaining10 ◦C under magnetic stirring in ice bath. The mixture was heated to 35 ◦C governed by a water bath.After 2 h of stirring, the reaction mixture was sonicated 10 times with the help of ultrasonicator. To stopthe reaction, deionized water (200 mL) and 1 M NaOH solution were added dropwise to maintain thepH = 6 of solution mixture. The reaction process was then followed with the addition of H2O2 (15 mL)which led to a change in suspension color to yellow. The mixture was kept overnight. Thereafter,the solution of ascorbic acid (0.227 mol L−1) was added dropwise under magnetic stirring at 95 ◦C.In this step, the color of the solution changes slowly from greenish-yellow to black. Finally, the mixturewas allowed to settle down for 1 h. Black precipitates were formed which were then centrifuged andwashed several times using ethanol.2.3. Synthesis of Gum Tragacanth-cl-N,N-dimethylacrylamide (GT-cl-poly(DMA)) HydrogelMicrowave-assisted copolymerization method was used in the synthesis of gumtragacanth-cl-N,N-dimethylacrylamide hydrogel [5]. In a typical reaction, 0.5 g of gum tragacanth(GT) (in 11 mL of deionized water) was taken in 50 mL beaker, stirred until GT was uniformly mixedwith distilled water. After this, KPS (10 × 10−1 mol L−1) and NMBA (5.8 × 10−1 mol L−1) wereadded into the GT solution. Magnetic stirring was continued to get a homogenous mixture andthen 4.4 × 10−1 mol L−1 of DMA was added in this mixture. The solution mixture was placed undermicrowave radiations for 90 s to generate active radicals needed for the initiation of the polymerizationreaction. The prepared gel was washed using acetone and dried inside the preheated (50 ◦C) hot airoven for 24 h.2.4. Synthesis of Reduced Graphene Oxide Incorporated Gum Tragacanth-cl-N,N-dimethylacrylamide(GT-cl-poly(DMA)/RGO) Hydrogel CompositeFor the preparation of reduced graphene oxide incorporated gumtragacanth-cl-N,N-dimethylacrylamide hydrogel composite, 0.5 g of GT was added in a solution ofRGO (0.005–0.025 g in 11 mL of deionized water). Physical agitation was applied until the mixturebecomes homogenously uniform. Thereafter, the mixture was treated similarly following the procedurein Section 2.3. The incorporation of RGO was confirmed physically by monitoring the color changefrom light orange to black, as presented in Scheme 1. The optimized quantities that are used in thepreparation of hydrogels are given in Table 3.98Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 1616Scheme 1. General scheme for the synthesis of gum tragacanth-cl-N,N-dimethylacrylamidehydrogel and reduced graphene oxide incorporated gum tragacanth-cl-N,N-dimethylacrylamidehydrogel composite.Table 3.

CharacterizationFourier transform infrared spectra of GT, RGO, gum tragacanth-cl-N,N-dimethylacrylamidehydrogel and reduced graphene oxide incorporated gum tragacanth-cl-N,N-dimethylacrylamidehydrogel composite were measured through L1600312 spectrum TWOLITA/ZnSe FTIRspectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Field emission scanning electronmicroscopy images were collected at different resolutions from a Nova Nano SEM-450 FESEM (JFEI,USA (S.E.A.), Hillsboro, ORE, USA). X-ray powder diffraction was collected from a SmartLab 9 kWrotating anode x-ray diffractometer (Rigaku Corporation, Tokyo, Japan).99Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 16162.6. Swelling StudyVarious parameters such as initiator concentration (KPS) solvent volume, time, cross-linkerconcentration (NMBA), microwave power, monomer concentration (DMA) and amount ofRGO were optimized to obtain the maximum swelling percentage. The swelling percentagesof gum tragacanth-cl-N,N-dimethylacrylamide and reduced graphene oxide incorporated gumtragacanth-cl-N,N-dimethylacrylamide hydrogels in deionized water were examined for a fixedperiod of 16 h. The pre-weighed dry piece of the sample was added in 50 mL of distilled water for 16 h.Then, swelled hydrogel was weighed. The swelling percentage was calculated using Equation (1) [28]:Swelling % =Ws − WdWd× 100 (1)where, Ws = weight of swelled gum tragacanth-cl-N,N-dimethylacrylamide hydrogel, Wd = weight ofdry gum tragacanth-cl-N,N-dimethylacrylamide hydrogel.2.7. Adsorption of Hg2+ and Cr6+The batch adsorption analyses were performed in 150 mL beaker using adsorption shaker (200 rpm)at pH of 5.5 and 3.5 for Hg2+ and Cr6+ removal respectively. For more illustration, 0.010–0.070 gof adsorbents were used in Hg2+ and Cr6+ ions solution (50 mL, 20 ppm) at 25 ◦C for fixed period.After adsorption, the mixture was filtered to determine the concentration of Hg2+ and Cr6+ ions using1,3-diphenylcarbazide method [14]. The concentration of adsorbed Hg2+ and Cr6+ was calculated byevaluating the absorbance of heavy metal ion solution using UV-Vis spectrophotometer at 532 nm and370 nm respectively. The amount of adsorbed Hg2+ and Cr6+ was calculated by Equation (2) [28]:qe =(Co −Ce)VM(2)where qe = equilibrium gum tragacanth-cl-N,N-dimethylacrylamide and reduced graphene oxideincorporated gum tragacanth-cl-N,N-dimethylacrylamide adsorption capacity, Co = initial Hg2+ andCr6+ concentration (mg L−1), Ce = equilibrium Hg2+ and Cr6+ concentration (mg L−1), V = volume(L) of Hg2+ and Cr6+ ion solution, M = weight (g) of gum tragacanth-cl-N,N-dimethylacrylamideand reduced graphene oxide incorporated gum tragacanth-cl-N,N-dimethylacrylamide hydrogels.Adsorption-desorption analyses were conducted by using 0.1 M HNO3. We have optimized theHNO3 concentration (0.02 M, 0.04 M, 0.06 M, 0.08 M, 0.1 M, 0.12 M) for desorption experiments.The maximum adsorption-desorption rate was found at optimized 0.1 M HNO3. The Hg2+ and Cr6+loaded GT-cl-poly(DMA) hydrogel and GT-cl-poly(DMA)/RGO hydrogel composite were desorbedby using 100 mL of 0.1 M HNO3 followed by neutralization with 0.1 M NaOH. Finally, the desorbedadsorbent was washed by distilled water and dried at room temperature for further adsorption ofHg2+ and Cr6+.3. Results3.1. Mechanism for Synthesis of Gum Tragacanth-cl-N,N-dimethylacrylamide HydrogelIn this work, gum tragacanth-cl-N,N-dimethylacrylamide hydrogel and reduced graphene oxideincorporated gum tragacanth-cl-N,N-dimethylacrylamide hydrogel composite were prepared by radicalcopolymerization of DMA and GT in the presence radical initiator (KPS) and the cross-linking actionof NMBA. Under microwave radiations, KPS was decomposed and radical ions were generated [25].These primary free radicals led to the generation of DMA monomer radical (through additionreaction with KPS) and GT alkoxy radical (through abstraction of hydrogen by KPS). The graftingof DMA radical and GT alkoxy radical was carried through radical copolymerization reaction(Scheme 1). The crosslinker NMBA led to the cross-linkages between different chains to facilitate the100Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 1616construction of three-dimensional gum tragacanth-cl-N,N-dimethylacrylamide hydrogel polymericnetwork. Finally, the dispersion of RGO led to the generation of reduced graphene oxide incorporatedgum tragacanth-cl-N,N-dimethylacrylamide hydrogel composite.3.2. Optimization of Swelling for Reduced Graphene Oxide Incorporated Gum Tragacanth-cl-N,N-dimethylacrylamide Hydrogel Composite3.2.1. Initiator (KPS) ConcentrationThe swelling percentage of GT-cl-poly(DMA) hydrogel was affected by the concentration of KPSand results are shown in Figure 1a. The maximum swelling of 565.5% was observed at 10 × 10−1 mol L−1of KPS. Below this concentration (<10 × 10−1 mol L−1), the swelling percentage was lower due toinadequate initiator, which was unable to produce appropriate active sites on GT-cl-poly(DMA).Figure 1. Effect of (a) initiator (KPS) concentration, (b) reaction time (s), (c) amount of solvent (mL),(d) microwave power (%), (e) monomer (DMA) concentration, (f) cross-linker (NMBA) concentrationand (g) amount of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) on gum tragacanth-cl-N,N-dimethylacrylamidehydrogel swelling.101Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 16163.2.2. Reaction TimeThe GT-cl-poly(DMA) hydrogel showed the highest swelling percentage (657.8%) at 90 s (Figure 1b).The swelling percentage was decreased from 90 s to 130 s, this might be due to the formation of excessbranched chains that could inhibit the expansion of the polymer.3.2.3. SolventThe solvent volume was varied from 5 mL to 13 mL in the formation of GT-cl-poly(DMA) hydrogel(Figure 1c). The maximum swelling (784.4%) was obtained at solvent volume of 11 mL. At highersolvent volume beyond 11 mL, the swelling percentage of GT-cl-poly(DMA) hydrogel was decreased,the excess solvent volume lowered the concentration of KPS, DMA and NMBA resulted in poor degreeof polymerization.3.2.4. Microwave PowerThe swelling percentage was maximum at 20% of microwave power for GT-cl-poly(DMA) hydrogel(Figure 1d). The swelling percentage was lower at microwave power above 20%. This was due tothe formation of excess radical led to increase the homo-polymerization rate reaction. Hence, themicrowave power was kept at 20% for further synthesis reaction of GT-cl-poly(DMA) hydrogel.3.2.5. Monomer (DMA) ConcentrationThe swelling percentage was affected by concentration of monomer (DMA) used in thedevelopment of GT-cl-poly(DMA) hydrogel. The maximum swelling percentage was observedat 4.4 × 10−1 mol L−1 of DMA concentration (Figure 1e). The increase in the concentration of DMAmonomer from 4.4 × 10−1 mol L−1 to 22.05 × 10−1 mol L−1 led to decrease the swelling percentage dueto the self cross-linking of DMA.3.2.6. Cross-Linker (NMBA)Figure 1f demonstrates the effect of NMBA concentration (5.8 × 10−1–29.4 × 10−1 mol L−1) on theswelling percentage of GT-cl-poly(DMA) hydrogel. The recorded highest swelling percentage was957.2% at NMBA concentration of 5.8 × 10−1 mol L−1. Beyond 5.8 × 10−1 mol L−1, the excess networkwas developed due to the more cross-linking points. Thus, the excess network led to decrease theavailable pores and swelling percentage of GT-cl-poly(DMA) hydrogel.3.2.7. RGO LoadingFigure 1g shows the influence of RGO loading on the swelling of GT-cl-poly(DMA) hydrogel.The rise in the amount of RGO from 0.005 g to 0.020 g was attributed to an increase in swellingpercentage. This was due to an increase in hydrophilic group and surface area of GT-cl-poly(DMA) onthe incorporation of RGO. Any further increase in RGO loading (> 0.020 g) was found to decreasethe swelling percentage of GT-cl-poly(DMA) hydrogel. This might be attributed to the increasedcross-linking density of composite hydrogel networks and the aggregations of excessive RGO in thehydrogel matrix.3.3. FTIRThe FTIR graphs of samples are presented in Figure 2. In spectrum of RGO (Figure 2a), broadbandof nearly 3358 cm−1 can be attributed to –OH stretching mode. The peak at 1421 cm−1 corresponds tothe carboxylic acid and peak at 1625 cm−1 belongs to the –C=C group in the aromatic rings. The peakat 1128 cm−1 is due to –C–O stretching in the C–OH functional groups of RGO [29]. The shifting of–C–O stretching from 1128 cm−1 to 1125 cm−1 in GT-cl-poly(DMA)/RGO hydrogel composite is relatedto the successful incorporation of RGO in GT-cl-poly(DMA) hydrogel. The bands at 1638 cm−1 and1748 cm−1 correspond to asymmetric stretching of the carboxylate group and asymmetric stretching of102Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 1616C=O in galacturonic acid respectively [30], peak at 1142 cm−1 ascribed to antisymmetric vibrationsof C–O–C linkage in glycosidic groups [31]. The asymmetric stretching of C=O shows shifting ofpeaks from 1748 cm−1 to 1750 cm−1 after the crosslinking of poly(DMA). The GT-cl-poly(DMA)/RGOhydrogel composite (Figure 2a) shows shift related to asymmetric stretching of C=O from 1750 cm−1to 1758 cm−1 suggesting interaction between RGO and GT-cl-poly(DMA) hydrogel. The peaks at1608 cm−1 and 1410 cm−1 in GT-cl-poly(DMA) hydrogel ascribed to stretching vibrations of poly(DMA)amide group [32]. These stretching vibrations of poly(DMA) show peak shifting from 1608 cm−1 to1612 cm−1 and from 1410 cm−1 to 1403 cm−1 in GT-cl-poly(DMA)/RGO hydrogel composite whichconfirms the changes in the structure of poly(DMA) after RGO incorporation. In GT-cl-poly(DMA)/RGO,the broadband of O–H stretching vibration shifted from 3403 cm−1 to 3382 cm−1 which may be attributedto the RGO interaction with GT-cl-poly(DMA) through intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The peaksintensity of GT-cl-poly(DMA)/RGO hydrogel composite is slightly lower than the GT-cl-poly(DMA)hydrogel, which also confirms the RGO dispersion in GT-cl-poly(DMA)/RGO hydrogel composite.The absorption band at 2910 cm−1 was attributed to stretching vibrations of aliphatic C–H [10]. Also,peaks at 1048 cm−1 and 1052 cm−1 in the spectra of hydrogels correspond to the –C–O bending.After the adsorption of Hg2+ and Cr6+ on GT-cl-poly(DMA) hydrogel and GT-cl-poly(DMA)/RGOhydrogel composite, peak due to carboxylate groups was shifted from 1612 cm−1 to 1621 cm−1 andthe intensity of the peaks decreases (Figure 2b). The peaks at 1410 cm−1 and 1048 cm−1 were shiftedto 1403 cm−1 and 1061 cm−1 respectively, which was probably due to the interactions of metal ionsto the active site of adsorbent. The peaks intensity of Hg2+ loaded GT-cl-poly(DMA) hydrogeland GT-cl-poly(DMA)/RGO hydrogel composite was lower than the Cr6+ loaded GT-cl-poly(DMA)hydrogel and GT-cl-poly(DMA)/RGO hydrogel composite, which supports higher Hg2+ adsorptionthan Cr6+ adsorption.Figure 2. Fourier transform infrared of (a) gum tragacanth (GT), gum tragacanth-cl-N,N-dimethylacrylamide (GT-cl-poly(DMA)) hydrogel, RGO and reduced graphene oxide incorporatedgum tragacanth-cl-N,N-dimethylacrylamide (GT-cl-poly(DMA)/RGO) hydrogel composite, (b) Hg2+and Cr6+ loaded GT-cl-poly(DMA) hydrogel and GT-cl-poly(DMA)/RGO hydrogel composite.3.4. XRDThe XRD pattern of GT, gum tragacanth-cl-N,N-dimethylacrylamide hydrogel (GT-cl-poly(DMA)),RGO and reduced graphene oxide incorporated gum tragacanth-cl-N,N-dimethylacrylamide hydrogelcomposite (GT-cl-poly(DMA)/RGO) is shown in Figure 3. The RGO formation was confirmed by thecharacteristic peak at 2θ = 24.3◦ [33]. On applying Bragg’s law, the calculated interlayer spacing ofRGO was 0.367 nm. Another peak of RGO at 2θ = 43.6◦ corresponded to the fingermark of graphiteindicating the regeneration of graphitic onto RGO [34]. According to Scherrer’s formula the calculatedparticle size of RGO at 2θ = 24.3◦ was 0.894 nm. In the case of GT, the diffraction peak occurred103Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 1616at 2θ = 22.9◦ and 26.2◦, exhibited semi-crystalline in nature [35]. The slight shifting of the peak at2θ = 26.6◦ in XRD pattern of GT-cl-poly(DMA) hydrogel confirms the crosslinking of DMA withpolysaccharide by destroying semi-crystalline structure into the amorphous structure. The broad peakin GT-cl-poly(DMA)/RGO hydrogel composite indicates the poor ordered arrangement of RGO inGT-cl-poly(DMA) hydrogel supported by SEM morphology.Figure 3. X-ray diffraction pattern for gum tragacanth (GT), gum tragacanth-cl-N,N-dimethylacrylamide(GT-cl-poly(DMA)) hydrogel, RGO and reduced graphene oxide incorporated gumtragacanth-cl-N,N-dimethylacrylamide (GT-cl-poly(DMA)/RGO) hydrogel composite.3.5. SEMMicroscopic images of RGO, gum tragacanth-cl-N,N-dimethylacrylamide hydrogel and reducedgraphene oxide incorporated gum tragacanth-cl-N,N-dimethylacrylamide hydrogel composite areshown in Figure 4. In RGO, Figure 4a shows the aggregated wrinkled structure, which meansparticles were closely associated. The RGO morphology showed the formation of agglomerated RGOwith estimated average grain size of 20–25 nm. Figure 4b shows the distribution of certain bulgeson a quite smooth, porous and compact surface of gum tragacanth-cl-N,N-dimethylacrylamidehydrogel. After the incorporation of RGO, reduced graphene oxide incorporated gumtragacanth-cl-N,N-dimethylacrylamide hydrogel composite showed (Figure 4c) the rough and irregularsurface with reduced size which was beneficial in fast adsorption of Hg2+ and Cr6+.3.6. EDSThe elemental distribution of carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, mercury and chromium in hydrogelmatrix was evaluated by EDS analysis and the spectra for Hg2+ adsorbed GT-cl-DMA hydrogel, Hg2+adsorbed GT-cl-poly(DMA)/RGO hydrogel composite, Cr6+ adsorbed GT-cl-poly(DMA) and Cr6+adsorbed GT-cl-poly(DMA)/RGO are presented in Figure 5. It is evident from the elemental analysisthat Hg2+ and Cr6+ ions were successfully adsorbed by GT-cl-poly(DMA) and GT-cl-poly(DMA)/RGO.Importantly, the weight percentages of Hg2+ and Cr6+ ions were higher in the case of Hg2+adsorbed GT-cl-poly(DMA)/RGO (6.68%) (Figure 5b) and Cr6+ adsorbed GT-cl-poly(DMA)/RGO(0.86%) (Figure 5d) than the Hg2+ adsorbed GT-cl-poly(DMA) (1.20%) (Figure 5a) and Cr6+ adsorbedGT-cl-poly(DMA) (0.46%) respectively (Figure 5c). Hence, GT-cl-poly(DMA)/RGO hydrogel compositeshowed better adsorption capability than GT-cl-poly(DMA) hydrogel. Also, the weight percentage ofcarbon is higher the in case of GT-cl-poly(DMA)/RGO hydrogel composite than the GT-cl-poly(DMA)hydrogel which confirmed the successful dispersion of RGO in GT-cl-poly(DMA) hydrogel matrix.104Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 1616Figure 4.

Influence of RGO Loading on the Removal of Hg2+ and Cr6+In the GT-cl-poly(DMA) hydrogel matrix, different quantities of RGO (0.005 g, 0.01 g, 0.015 g, 0.02 gand 0.025 g) were incorporated to study the effect RGO loading on metal ions removal. The adsorptionpercentages for without RGO were 70.6% and 20.4% for Hg2+ and Cr6+ respectively. The adsorptionpercentages for Hg2+ (Figure 6a) and Cr6+ (Figure 6b) ions were enhanced on raising the concentrationof RGO from 0.005 g to 0.020 g. The RGO contains carboxylic groups which boost interactions withmetal ions resulting in high percentage adsorption [30]. The removal efficiency of Hg2+ and Cr6+ was90.7% and 38.4% at RGO loading of 0.020 g. The development of tough three-dimensional networkswas responsible for the decrease in adsorption percentage at higher RGO loading (>0.020). Therefore,0.020 g was the optimized dose of RGO in the formation of GT-cl-poly(DMA)/RGO for removal ofHg2+ and Cr6+.Figure 6. Cont.106Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 1616Figure 6.

The removal percentage of Hg2+ was first increased from pH 1.5(77.6% for GT-cl-poly(DMA), 86.3% for GT-cl-poly(DMA)/RGO) to 5.5 (86.1% for GT-cl-poly(DMA),97.6% for GT-cl-poly(DMA)/RGO) and then decreased from pH 5.5 (86.1%, 97.6%) to 9.5 (72.5%,84.2%). The reported highest removal efficiencies for Hg2+ were 86.1% and 97.6% by GT-cl-poly(DMA)hydrogel and GT-cl-poly(DMA)/RGO) hydrogel composite respectively at 5.5 pH. At low pH, theconcentration of H+ ions was high which could compete with Hg2+ on GT-cl-poly(DMA)/RGO surfaceresulting in poor binding of Hg2+ [36]. However, high pH was responsible for the decrease in theconcentration of H+ ions in the solution and improves the binding potential of Hg2+ ions to the surfaceof GT-cl-poly(DMA)/RGO) (Scheme 2a). Hence adsorption of Hg2+ was increased from pH 1.1 to 5.5.The dominant species were Hg(OH)2 and HgCl42− [37] at pH above 5.5. The electrostatic repulsionamong Hg(OH)2 or HgCl42− [38] and negatively charged GT-cl-poly(DMA)/RGO) was responsible forlow Hg2+ adsorption percentage at pH above 5.5.In the case of Cr6+, the recorded maximum adsorption percentages were 76.1% and81.5% (Figure 6d) for GT-cl-poly(DMA) hydrogel and GT-cl-poly(DMA)/RGO hydrogel compositecorrespondingly at pH 3.5. The dominant Cr6+ species [39] are as: H2CrO4 (pH < 3.5), HCrO−4 (pH < 7),CrO2−4 (pH> 7). The Cr6+ ions were exists in solution as negatively charged HCrO−4 at pH 3.5. Therefore,electrostatic attraction of HCrO−4 [40] took place at pH 3.5 with protonated positively charged groupof GT-cl-poly(DMA)/RGO) (Scheme 2b). Hence, Cr6+ exhibited maximum adsorption percentage at3.5 pH. At pH< 3.5, electrostatic attraction for adsorption was reduced due to the dominance of H2CrO4.Also, with increasing pH from 3.5 to 7, the protonated group on GT-cl-poly(DMA)/RGO decreaseswhich reduces the electrostatic attraction. At pH > 7, electrostatic repulsion between dominant CrO2−4species [40] and deprotonated GT-cl-poly(DMA)/RGO was attributed to low Cr6+ adsorption.107Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 1616Scheme 2.

Influence of GT-cl-poly(DMA) Hydrogel and GT-cl-poly(DMA)/RGO Hydrogel Composite Dosefor Removal of Hg2+ and Cr6+The effect of adsorbents dosages (0.015 – 0.065 g) on the removal of metal ions are represented inFigure 6e,f. The adsorption percentage was increased by increasing the adsorbent dosage. This wasdue to the existence of more adsorption sites with enhanced dose of adsorbent. The removal efficienciesof Hg2+ were found to be 86.4% and 98.4% by GT-cl-poly(DMA) hydrogel and GT-cl-poly(DMA)/RGOhydrogel composite correspondingly at dose of 0.035 g. The reported Cr6+ ion removal percentageswere 77.2% and 82.3% by using GT-cl-poly(DMA) hydrogel and GT-cl-poly(DMA)/RGO hydrogelcomposite respectively at optimized dose of 0.045 g. Thus, 0.035 g (for Hg2+) and 0.045 g (for Cr6+)were the ideal doses used for experiments.3.8. Adsorption KineticsThe pseudo first-order rate equation is given as:log(qe − qt)= logqe −K12.303t (3)where, qe and qt are the adsorption capacity at equilibrium (mg g−1) and time t respectively and K1 isthe pseudo first order kinetics rate constant.The pseudo second-order rate equation is given as:tqt=1K2 q2e+tqe(4)where K2 is the pseudo second-order kinetics rate constant.The removal mechanism for Hg2+ and Cr6+ by GT-cl-poly(DMA) and GT-cl-poly(DMA)/RGO weresolved by different kinetic models as given in Equations (3) and (4). The parameters (pseudo-first-order:R2, K1, qe) were calculated from Figure 7a,b (Table 4). The parameters (pseudo-second-order:K2, qe) and correlation coefficient (R2) were calculated from Figure 7c,d (Table 4). The higherR2 values for the pseudo-second-order kinetic model supports Hg2+ and Cr6+ ions adsorptiononto GT-cl-poly(DMA) hydrogel and GT-cl-poly(DMA)/RGO hydrogel composite through thepseudo-second-order kinetic model.108Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 1616Figure 7.

Adsorption IsothermsThe Langmuir model is expressed according to Equation (5) as:Ceqe=1qmb+Ceqm(5)where Ce is the equilibrium concentration of metal ions solution, qe is the amount of equilibriumadsorbed metal ions, qm is maximum adsorption capacity and b is the Langmuir isotherm constant.The separation factor RL of Langmuir isotherm was examined by using Equation (6) as:RL =11 + b×Co (6)109Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 1616where Co represent the initial concentration of metal ions. The RL values show the nature of adsorptioni.e. irreversible (RL = 0), linear (RL = 1), unfavorable (RL > 1) and favorable (0 < RL < 1). The Freundlichisotherm model is given by Equation (7) as:lnqe = lnKF +1nlnCe (7)where KF and n are Freundlich constants and indicate the adsorption capacity and adsorption intensityof adsorbent respectively.The interaction between adsorbent (GT-cl-poly(DMA) hydrogel and GT-cl-poly(DMA)/RGOhydrogel composite) and adsorbate (Hg2+ and Cr6+) was explained through isotherms model Equations(5) and (7). The Langmuir parameters were calculated from the graph between Ce/qe and Ce(Figure 8a–d) and presented in Table 5. The Freundlich parameters were determined from thegraph of lnqe vs lnCe (Figure 9a–d) and depicted in Table 5. For the Langmuir isotherm, thehigher R2 suggests that the Langmuir isotherm was best suited for the removal of Hg2+ and Cr6+ions on GT-cl-poly(DMA) hydrogel and GT-cl-poly(DMA)/RGO hydrogel composite. For Hg2+,GT-cl-poly(DMA) and GT-cl-poly(DMA)/RGO showed higher removal capacity of 625 mg g−1 and666.6 mg g−1 respectively. Similarly, for Cr6+, the maximum reported removal capacities were401.6 mg g−1 and 473.9 mg g−1 by GT-cl-poly(DMA) hydrogel and GT-cl-poly(DMA)/RGO hydrogelcomposite respectively.Figure 8.

Relationship between the Adsorption and SwellingFor the investigation of the correlation between the swelling of GT-cl-poly(DMA)/RGO hydrogelcomposite and adsorption of the Hg2+ and Cr6+ onto GT-cl-poly(DMA)/RGO hydrogel composite,the adsorption percentage was determined using aqueous metal solution (20 mg L−1) and the swellingexperiments were performed in distilled water. The relationship between the adsorption values versusswelling values is presented in Figure 10. It is clear from Figure 10 that the adsorption percentageis directly proportional to the swelling percentage of the adsorbent. The adsorption percentages forHg2+ and Cr6+ were increased from 78.9% to 90.7% and 29.8% to 38.4% respectively when the swellingpercentage of GT-cl-poly(DMA)/RGO rise from 834.6% to 971.9%.Figure 10. Adsorption percentage and swelling percentage of reduced graphene oxide incorporatedgum tragacanth-cl-N,N-dimethylacrylamide (GT-cl-poly(DMA)/RGO) hydrogel composite.3.11. Adsorption-Desorption StudyFor an ideal adsorbent, ability for regeneration without considerable loss of removal percentage isof paramount importance. The five cycles of adsorption-desorption and their effects on percentageadsorption are presented in Figure 11. The Hg2+ ions adsorption percentages were 83.4% (1st cycle),80.9% (2nd cycle), 78.4% (3rd cycle), 75% (4th cycle), 73.6% (5th cycle) and 94.1% (1st cycle), 92.7%(2nd cycle), 89.8% (3rd cycle), 87.9% (4th cycle), 85.5% (5th cycle) for GT-cl-poly(DMA) hydrogel andGT-cl-poly(DMA)/RGO hydrogel composite respectively (Figure 11a). For Cr6+, GT-cl-poly(DMA)and GT-cl-poly(DMA)/RGO exhibited 77.2% (1st cycle), 74.7% (2nd cycle), 71% (3rd cycle), 68.4% (4thcycle), 66.3% (5th cycle) and 82.3% (1st cycle), 80.1% (2nd cycle), 78.5% (3rd cycle), 76.9% (4th cycle),73.1% (5th cycle) respectively (Figure 11b). Hence, the synthesized GT-cl-poly(DMA) hydrogel andGT-cl-poly(DMA)/RGO hydrogel composite can be effectively reused for up to five cycles, which leadsto reduction in cost.112Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 1616Figure 11. Recycling ability of gum tragacanth-cl-N,N-dimethylacrylamide (GT-cl-poly(DMA))hydrogel and reduced graphene oxide incorporated gum tragacanth-cl-N,N-dimethylacrylamide(GT-cl-poly(DMA)/RGO) hydrogel composite for the removal of (a) Hg2+ and (b) Cr6+ metal ions up tofive cycles.4. ConclusionsWe developed novel reduced graphene oxide incorporated gum tragacanth-cl-N,N-dimethylacrylamide (GT-cl-poly(DMA)/RGO) hydrogel composite as reusable adsorbent for Hg2+and Cr6+ ions. The reported maximum swelling percentage was 971.9% for reduced graphene oxideincorporated gum tragacanth-cl-N,N-dimethylacrylamide hydrogel composite at optimized synthesisconditions (KPS concentration: 10.0 × 10−1 mol L−1, solvent: 11 mL, reaction time: 90 s, microwavepower: 20%, DMA concentration: 4.4 × 10−1 mol L−1, NMBA concentration: 5.8 × 10−1 mol L−1 andamount of RGO: 0.020 g). The adsorption efficiencies of 99% and 82% were reported for Hg2+ and Cr6+by using GT-cl-poly(DMA)/RGO hydrogel composite at optimized adsorption conditions (for Hg2+, pH:5.5, adsorbent dose: 0.035 g, RGO loading: 0.020 g, Hg2+ concentration: 20 ppm, Hg2+ volume: 50 mL,time: 270 min, temperature: 25 ◦C and for Cr6+, pH: 3.5, adsorbent dose: 0.045 g, RGO loading: 0.020 g,Cr6+ concentration: 20 ppm, Cr6+ volume: 50 mL, time: 570 min, temperature: 25 ◦C). The Qmax ofHg2+ and Cr6+ onto reduced graphene oxide incorporated gum tragacanth-cl-N,N-dimethylacrylamidehydrogel composite were 666.6 mg g−1 and 473.9 mg g−1 correspondingly, which were higher than theQmax of gum tragacanth-cl-N,N-dimethylacrylamide hydrogel (Hg2+ = 625 mg g−1, Cr6+ = 401.6 mgg−1). The Hg2+ and Cr6+ adsorption were better depicted through pseudo-second-order and Langmuirisotherm. The gum tragacanth-cl-N,N-dimethylacrylamide and reduced graphene oxide incorporatedgum tragacanth-cl-N,N-dimethylacrylamide adsorbents can be effectively reused for up to five cyclesfor adsorption of Hg2+ and Cr6+ ions. Thus, developed adsorbents are highly efficient in heavy metalion adsorption and can be exploited for environmental remediation application.Author Contributions: Experiments, B.S.; original draft writing, B.S., S.T.; data analysis, B.S., S.T.; writing, reviewand editing, S.T., V.K.T., D.T., H.Y.N.; supervision, S.T., V.K.T.

The influence of GNP content ranging from 0 to 50 wt.% on the mechanical and electricalproperties was investigated using the tensile test and Hall effect measurement, respectively. It showedthat the tensile strength of the hybrid film is decreasing with the increase of the GNP content whilethe electrical conductivity exhibits an opposite trend. The effectiveness of the MWCNT/GNP hybrid filmas a strain sensor is presented. The specimen is subjected to a flexural loading, and the electrical resistancemeasured by a two-point probe method is found to be function of applied strain. Experimental resultsdemonstrate that there are two different linear strain-sensing stages (0–0.2% and 0.2–1%) in the resistanceof the hybrid film with applied strain. The strain sensitivity is increasing with the increase of the GNPcontent. In addition, the repeatability and stability of the strain sensitivity of the hybrid film wereconformed through the cyclic loading–unloading tests. The MWCNT/GNP hybrid film shows promisingapplication for strain sensing.Keywords: graphene nanoplatelet; multi-walled carbon nanotube; hybrid film; vacuum filtration;strain sensing1. IntroductionSince the discoveries of carbon nanotubes (CNT) by Iijima [1] and graphene nanoplatelets (GNP)by Novoselov et al. [2], they have received a great attention as raw materials for the developmentof nanomaterials due to their excellent thermal, electrical and mechanical properties, low densityand high specific surface area [3]. Nowadays, enormous efforts have been devoted to the use ofCNT and graphene in various applications, such as energy storage [4,5], field effect transistors(FETs) [6], electrodes [7,8] and sensors [9,10]. Thin films or paper-like materials consisting of GNP orCNT have drawn extensive attention and they are being widely employed for supercapacitors [11],pressure sensors [12], monitoring cure behavior of polymer composite [13], flexible temperaturesensors [14], and as reinforcing fillers in polymers [15–17]. These free-standing thin films are cohesivelybound by van der Waals interactions among entangled CNTs and GNPs. The main idea behindthe fabrication of thin film is to utilize the excellent properties of individual GNP and CNT inmacroscopic form. This thin film is advantageous to facilitate easier handling of GNPs and CNTsand to improve the capability of using GNPs and CNTs in industry [18]. These thin films are suitablefor both lightweight structural and functional applications.Nanomaterials 2018, 8, 786; doi:10.3390/nano8100786 www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials117Nanomaterials 2018, 8, 786Flexible strain sensors have been highly desirable in applications such as electronic skin,structural health monitoring, and robot sensors in recent years. CNT and GNP are applicable forpiezoresistive strain sensors and have been of great interest among researchers. Lu et al. [19] employeda flexible GNP/epoxy strain sensor to monitor the deformation and damage in structural composites.Liu et al. [20] reported a highly reliable strain sensor based on graphene composite film with layeredstructure. Moriche et al. [21] studied the strain monitoring mechanism of GNPs incorporatedinto epoxy matrix. Sanli et al. [22] investigated the piezoresistive performance of strain-sensitiveMWCNT/epoxy nanocomposites. Wang et al. [23] utilized a CNT composite film as a strainsensor to monitor biaxial strain under tensile tests. Wang et al. [24] developed a new processingtechnique of MWCNT strain sensors with tunable strain gauge factors. Natarajan et al. [25] examinedthe efficiency and effectiveness in terms of piezoresistive properties of natural rubber compositesbased on MWCNT, carbon black and their mixtures (hybrid). The change of relative resistance,was found to be as much as ∼1300 at around 120% elongation. Boland et al. [26] incorporated grapheneinto a lightly cross-linked polysilicone, resulting in a change of its electromechanical propertiessubstantially. These nanocomposites were sensitive electromechanical sensors with gauge factors >500that can measure pulse, blood pressure, and even the impact associated with the footsteps of a smallspider. Li. et al. [27] fabricated flexible and electrical conductive carbon cotton/polydimethylsiloxanecomposites by vacuum-assisted infusion for highly sensitive pressure sensor. The flexible pressuresensor exhibited a maximum sensitivity of 6.04 KPa−1 in a wide working pressure up to 700 kPa. Samadet al. [28] developed a graphene foam/polydimethylsiloxane flexible sensor to sense both compressiveand bending strains in the form of change in electrical resistance. They found that resistances can beincreased to 120% and 52% of its original value by applying a 30% compressive strain and bendinga sample to a radius of 1 mm, respectively. Samad et al. [29] fabricated freestanding, mechanicallystable, and highly electrically conductive graphene foam with two-step facile, adaptable and scalabletechniques. They demonstrated the capability of graphene foam as strain/pressure sensor for bothhigh and low strains and pressures with tunable densities.The potential applications of CNTs and GNPs are limited because CNTs are easy to entangleand agglomerate due to the large aspect ratio and GNPs also tend to restack due to van der Waalsand strong interactions. One of the most efficient ways to avoid the agglomeration is to incorporateCNTs with GNPs to produce a nanocomposite material or a hybrid. CNTs can bridge adjacent graphenelayers and retard graphene interlayer stacking, resulting in an increased contact surface area betweenGNPs. Hybrid CNT/graphene films are typically bonded by π–π interaction, which can inducefunctionalization due to the difference in geometry between the GNP and the CNT. Apart fromthe non-covalent interaction, covalent bonds and hydrogen bonds have also been used to constructhybrid graphene and CNT nanomaterials, which are confirmed to be of ultrahigh strength, modulus,electrical conductivity and thermal performance [17]. Most of the existing literature, as mentionedabove, studied the sensing capability of the carbon nanomaterials such as MWCNT and GNPindividually. Relatively few studies have been reported on electrical and mechanical propertiesof hybrid films. This work seeks to explore the piezoresistive behavior and strain-sensing abilityof the MWCNT/GNP hybrid film. The synergistic effect of MWCNT and GNP on the electricalconductivity is presented. These are the novelty and originality of present work. In this study,MWCNT/GNP hybrid films were fabricated by vacuum filtration of mixed dispersion with variedMWCNT-to-GNP weight ratios. A series of hybrid films with different amounts of MWCNTs and GNPswere prepared. The loading of GNPs varied from 0 wt.% to 50 wt.% and that for MWCNTs was 100 wt.%to 50 wt.%, respectively. The effect of GNP content on mechanical properties, electrical conductivityand strain-sensing performance of hybrid films are investigated. A controllable strain sensitivityof the hybrid film can be achieved by varying the GNP content. It is important in understandingthe MWCNT/GNP hybrid films so as to further improve their properties for end applications.118Nanomaterials 2018, 8, 7862. ExperimentsIn this study, two types of nanomaterials, a multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT)and a graphene nanoplatelet (GNP), were used to fabricate the hybrid films with different weight ratios.2.1. MaterialsGNPs were purchased from UChees Co. (Taiwan, China) with 1~10 nm thickness, 0.5–20 μmlateral dimension and surface area of 400–700 m2/g. MWCNTs, grown by CVD, were purchased fromConjutek Co. Taiwan with the diameter in the range of 10–50 nm, length of 100–200 μm, surface areaof 400–700 m2/g, and purity >98.5%. Both of GNPs and MWCNTs were used as received withoutany modification.2.2. Film PreparationMWCNTs and GNPs have strong tendencies to form bundles and aggregate together becauseof their high surface area and the strong van der Waals interaction. They are also hydrophobicand have poor solubility in aqueous solutions [30]. In this study, the MWCNT/GNP hybrid filmswere prepared with the aid of surfactant Triton X-100. The molecular structure of surfactant TritonX-100 (Big Sun Chemical Corp., New Taipei City, Taiwan) contains a hydrophilic polyethylene oxidegroup and hydrocarbon lipophilic (or hydrophobic group), which improves the dispersibility ofMWCNTs and GNPs in aqueous solution [31]. The hybrid films with different weight ratios ofMWCNT and GNP were prepared using the following process. The total mass of MWCNTs and GNPswas held constant at 0.16 g. Surfactant Triton X-100 with the weight of 5 g were dissolved in 500 mldeionized water and dispersed by a sonicate tip (Q700, Qsonica L.L.C., Newtown, CT, USA) for 30 minat 30 W. The sonicator was operated at pulse mode (10 s on and 20 s off). Then, a total mass 0.16 gof MWCNTs and GNPs with a desired weight ratio were added to the suspension and dispersed bya sonicate tip for 3h at 30 W. Upon completion of the dispersion process, the MWCNT/GNP suspensionwas filtered through a Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) microporous membrane (pore size 0.45 μm,diameter 90 mm) by a vacuum filtration. The experimental setup of the vacuum filtration is shownin Figure 1. After filtration, the hybrid film was peeled off from the filter membrane and washed bya large amount of isopropyl alcohol to remove any residual surfactant. The film was dried in a vacuumoven preheated to 40 ◦C for 12h. The typical thickness of the hybrid film was 60–80 μm. Followingthe same process, a series of hybrid films with GNP weight percentage ranging from 0 wt.% to 50 wt.%were fabricated to investigate the effect of GNP on the mechanical and electrical properties. In thisstudy, hybrid films with GNP weight percentages of 0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% and 50% were denotedas GNP-0, GNP-10, GNP-20, GNP-30, GNP-40 and GNP-50, respectively.Figure 1. Experimental setup of the vacuum filtration and as-prepared hybrid film.119Nanomaterials 2018, 8, 7862.3. MorphologyField emission scanning electron microscope (JSM-7600F, Jeol Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) was performedto characterize the surface morphology and cross-section view of the hybrid film. An acceleratingvoltage of 10 kV and a working distance of 5–10 mm were adopted to generate the field emissionscanning electron microscope (FESEM) images of the hybrid film. The samples were sputter-coatedwith a conductive gold layer before taken the image.A typical MWCNT/GNP hybrid film is shown in Figure 1 It can be seen that the film is highlyflexible, which can be rolled up or bear small radius bending without any damage or fracture. The surfacemorphology and cross-section view of the hybrid film with 0 wt.% (GNP-0), 20 wt.% (GNP-20) and 50 wt.%(GNP-50) of GNP are presented in Figure 2. The surface morphology of the film GNP-0 (0 wt.% GNPand 100 wt.% MWCNT) exhibits homogenous and densely packed mass of randomly oriented MWCNTswithout any agglomeration, and this orientation gives rise to its isotropic properties as shown in Figure 2a.For the hybrid film GNP-20 (20 wt.% GNP and 80 wt.% MWCNT), most of the GNPs are coveredby the MWCNTs as shown in Figure 2c. As the content of GNP increases, some of the GNPs can beobserved on the top of MWCNTs as shown in Figure 2e for hybrid film GNP-50 (50 wt.% GNP and 50wt.% MWCNT). GNPs and MWCNTs are uniformly dispersed and highly entangled with each other.From the cross-section SEM images shown in Figure 2b,d and f, MWCNTs and GNPs are successfullydeposited to form densely packed film with layered structure. Similar layered structure with MWCNTsdistributed between GNP sheets in the flexible GNP/MWCNT film using as a high performancesupercapacitor was also reported by Lu et al. [11]. It can be attributed to the filtration-induced directionalflow during the fabrication process. Under the vacuum filtration pressure, the 2D GNP tended toself-adjust their basal planes parallel to the filter membrane plane due to the large aspect ratio of GNPsheets, resulting in significant alignment of GNP sheets [32]. Clearly, GNP sheets served as the supportersto hold the MWCNTs in-between, generating a more compact and aligned structure of hybrid films.Graphene sheets uniformly spread on MWCNTs and alternately stacked layer structure are observed.With the increase of GNP content, the long and tortuous MWCNTs are embedded between the GNPlayers, which can prevent the aggregation of GNPs. It appears that MWCNTs were preferentially orientedand bridged the gap between the GNP layers.Figure 2. Cont.120Nanomaterials 2018, 8, 786Figure 2.

Results and Discussions3.1. Mechanical PropertiesThe mechanical properties of hybrid film were evaluated by uniaxial tensile testing. The specimenswere cut into a rectangle strip with 30 mm in length and 10 mm in width. Tests were conducted usinga universal testing machine with 200 N load cell at a constant cross-head speed of 0.5 mm/min.To reveal the reproducibility of the results, three samples were fabricated and tested for each hybridfilm. The experimental results reported in this work are the averaged values.Figure 3 plots the typical stress–strain curves of the hybrid films with different GNP contentsranging from 0 wt.% to 50 wt.%. The mechanical properties including the Young’s modulus,tensile strength and fracture strain can be extracted from the stress–strain curve. Table 1 lists the tensilestrength and fracture strain of the hybrid films. Based on published literature, the mechanical propertiesof CNT buckypaper, tensile strength of 2–94 MPa, Young’s modulus of 2.1 MPa to 3.84 GPa, and fracturestrain of 0.3–2% have been reported [18]. Present results are within the range of typical MWCNTbuckypaper. It can be observed that both the tensile strength and fracture strain are decreasing withthe increase of the GNP content as shown in the inset of Figure 3. Tensile strength and fracture strainof GNP-0 (0 wt.% GNP and 100 wt.% MWCNT) are 17 MPa and 8.2%, respectively, which are 105%and 86% higher than that of GNP-50 (50 wt.% GNP and 50 wt.% MWCNT). These results can be121Nanomaterials 2018, 8, 786inferred from the SEM images that the MWCNT bundles exhibit not only strong Van der Waalsand π–π interactions but also mechanical interlocking through entanglements and form a strongrobust network [33]. However, the graphene sheets are mainly assembled by an in-plane contactingvia Van der Waals forces without being strongly inter-connected. Thus, the tensile strength of the hybridfilm is decreasing as the MWCNT content decreases.Figure 3. Stress-strain curves of the hybrid films with different weight percentage of graphenenanoplatelets (GNP).Table 1. Mechanical properties of the hybrid film with different weight percentage of graphenenanoplatelets (GNP).Hybrid Film Tensile Strength (MPa) Fracture Strain (%)GNP-0 17 ± 1.3 8.2 ± 0.7GNP-10 16 ± 0. 8 7.0 ± 0.8GNP-20 15 ± 1.0 6.5 ± 0.7GNP-30 14 ± 1.1 6.0 ± 0.8GNP-40 12 ± 0.6 5.1 ± 0.5GNP-50 8.3 ± 0.9 4.4 ± 0.7The enlarged stress–strain curves as shown in Figure 4 can be divided into three stages.In stage I (strain ranging from 0 to 0.2%), the wavy MWCNTs are first straightened upon tensileloading, causing little change in stress with linear stress-strain relationship [17]. In stage II(strain ranging from 0.2 to 1.0%), the deformation happens under fairly law stress and the jointsbetween MWCNTs and GNPs inside the film are stretched resulting in a higher elastic modulus whichis analogized to the disentanglement of polymer chain [18]. In stage III (strain >1.0%), with furtherstretching of the hybrid film, interlock between GNPs and MWCNTs gradually fails and the networkbecomes loosely, a non-linear stress-strain relationship is observed. At the initial stage of loading,significant straightening took place both in the GNPs [34] and MWCNTs leading to alignment alongthe tensile direction, after which the curves became almost linear at higher strains. Elastic moduli ofthe hybrid films in stages I and II of the tensile testing are shown in the inset of Figure 4. The elasticmodulus of the hybrid film in stage II is higher than that of stage I by approximately 200 MPa.It appears that GNPs were easier to be straightened due to the slippage of the overlapped GNPs;i.e., it is more flexible than MWCNTs which were interlocked with each other. The tensile strength122Nanomaterials 2018, 8, 786and Young’s modulus of the hybrid film measured as a function of GNP content are shown inFigures 3 and 4, respectively. Both properties consistently increased with decreasing GNP content,indicating the dominance of MWCNT on mechanical properties of the hybrid film.Figure 4. Enlarged stress –strain curve of MWCNT/GNP hybrid films.3.2. Electrical PropertiesThe sheet resistivity of the hybrid film was measured by the Hall effect (Ecopia HMS-3000).To demonstrate the reproducibility of the experimental results, three specimens with square shape(10 × 10 mm) were cut from different locations of the hybrid film and tested. The average valuewas reported with standard deviation.Table 2 lists the electrical resistivity and conductivity of the hybrid film with different weightpercentages of GNP. It can be seen that the conductivity of the hybrid film is increasing withthe increase of the content of GNP as shown in Figure 5. While both MWCNTs and GNPs arehighly conductive, GNPs are more conductive for two reasons. Firstly, their two-dimensionalnature results in a better connectivity and so a greater choice of conductive paths for electronsto flow through. Secondly, their planar nature allows them to pack more closely than MWCNTs,giving lower porosity [35]. Thus, GNP is the dominant factor on the electrical property of the hybridfilm. A remarkable increase in the electrical conductivity from 47.72 S/cm to 192.60 S/cm was observedwhen the GNP content was increased from 0 to 50 wt.%. The conductivity of the hybrid film GNP-50was enhanced by 304% in comparison with the GNP-0, due to the formation of 3D conductivenetworks [36]. The hybrid film exhibits a well-stacked layered structure throughout the cross section.The MWCNT network bridges the gap between the GNPs. Larger lateral dimension of GNP actsas a strong holder while MWCNT serves as a wire to connect GNP. The conductivity of the hybrid filmdepends on the conductive network formed by the MWCNTs and the inherent conductivity of GNPs.At a low weight fraction of GNP, MWCNT and GNP are not close-packed to form effective conductivepathways in the hybrid film. The overlap of MWCNTs introduces larger interfacial resistance thatfurther decreases the conductivity of the hybrid film with too much MWCNTs in the grapheme layer.When the fractions of GNPs were increased, the percolated network of MWCNTs and GNPs was formed123Nanomaterials 2018, 8, 786which provided efficiently conductive pathways for electron transfer in the hybrid film. The decreasein the sheet resistivity by incorporation of GNPs demonstrates that two-dimensional GNPs providea more efficient percolating network than one-dimensional MWCNTs. Furthermore, GNP workedas strong holders with a large surface area to support contact between the MWCNT and GNP,resulting in a further reduction of the contact resistance. In the MWCNT-dominated hybrid film,a pronounced synergistic effect on conductivity can be observed. The electrical conductivity is relatedto both in-plane and through-thickness conduction of electrons. It is clear to see from Figure 2 that 1-DMWCNTs act as bridges to connect 2-D GNPs and provide additional channels for the electron transferwithin the hybrid film. This leads to a decreased electrical resistance and may be considered as the majorreason for the synergistic effect of the MWCNT and GNP hybrid films. In addition, high electricalconductivity of GNP in the basal plane enhances the synergistic effect on electrical conductivity.Table 2.

Electrical conductivity of MWCNT/GNP hybrid films with different weight percentages of GNP.3.3. Self-Strain Sensing PropertiesThe prepared hybrid film was cut into a rectangular strip (30 × 10 mm) for evaluation ofthe piezoresistive response and sensing performance. The strain-monitoring capability of the hybridfilm sensor was tested in a flexural test. Electrical resistance and mechanical strain duringthe test were measured simultaneously by a digital Multimeter (Keithley 2450) and strain gauge,respectively. The hybrid film sensor was attached to the center of an Al (Al6064-T6) test specimen(dimensions: 200 × 19 × 2 mm) using epoxy to make perfect bonding between the specimen and hybridfilm sensor. When the load was applied on the Al specimen, the hybrid film bonded through highstrength epoxy and the metallic strain gauge experienced the same strain. Two copper electrodes wereadhered to the hybrid film sensor at a distance of 25 mm using silver paste to minimize the contact124Nanomaterials 2018, 8, 786resistance. The electrical resistance in monitoring tests was measured by the two-point method dueto the simplicity of the method regarding scalability to real applications [21]. Resistivity and straindata were recorded by the digital data acquisition system (cDAQ-9174 NI) through the Lab VIEWsoftware. In this work, a four-point-bending test was conducted to study the piezoresistive behaviorof the hybrid film sensor. The spans between the two inner points and two outer points are 60 mmand 120 mm, respectively. A schematic diagram and experimental setup of the four-point-bending testare shown in Figure 6.Figure 6. Schematic diagram and experimental setup of the four-point-bending test.The addition of GNPs increases the conductivity of the hybrid film as described in Section 3.2.Four-point-bending tests were performed to monitor the electrical resistance change of the hybrid filmwith different GNP contents induced by the strain. Gauge factor is an important parameter whichcan be used to describe the sensitivity of the strain sensor. It is defined as the ratio of the normalizedelectrical resistance and strain induced in the sensor as follows.GF =Δ R/R0ε(1)where ΔR is the resistance change with strain, R0 is the initial resistance prior to straining, ε isthe applied strain.125Nanomaterials 2018, 8, 786Representative normalized resistance–strain curves of the experimental results are plotted in Figure 7for various GNP contents ranging from 0 to 50 wt.%. It can be observed that the normalized resistancebehaves in positive piezoresistive trend, i.e., the normalized resistance change monotonic increases withthe increase of the strain. Moreover, the normalized resistance of the hybrid film is increasing withthe increase of GNP content. For the increase of the resistance curve, an evident change occurs aroundat the strain of 0.2%. The whole curve can be divided into two stages. In stage 1 (strain range 0–0.2%),the increase of the resistance tends to be linear with a small slope. In stage II (strain range 0.2–1%),the resistance change exhibits a linear relationship with a large slope. The slope of the curve representsthe gauge factor of the hybrid film which can be used to characterize the strain sensitivity of the hybridfilm sensor. The gauge factors of the hybrid films with different GNP contents for stage I and II arelisted in Table 3. It can be observed that the gauge factor is increasing with the increase of the GNPcontent as shown in Figure 8. Furthermore, gauge factor in stage I is larger than that of stage II. Asthe GNP content increases from 0 wt.% to 50 wt.%, the gauge factor increases from 1.16 to 2.34 in stage I,and increases from 1.54 to 3.56 in stage II. The mechanism corresponding to the increase of the resistancein the two stages can be explained as follows. The resistance of the hybrid film can be attributed tothree main aspects, namely, contact resistance, tunneling resistance and intrinsic resistance. In stageI, the gauge factor is mainly affected by intrinsic resistance, the relative displacements of MWCNTand GNP are small, the wavy carbon nanotubes are straightened under strain due to its large flexibility,and a smaller gauge factor is acquired. However, in stage II, the normalized resistance change (ΔR/R0)of the hybrid film is mainly relied on the contact and tunneling resistances of adjacent nanomaterialsheets. The conductivity between neighboring flakes is determined by their overlap area and the contactresistance [37]. The assumption in the sensitivity change of MWCNT/GNP hybrid films can be furtherexplained by the schematic diagram shown in Figure 9. Once a mechanical strain is applied to the hybridfilm, the overlap area between neighboring flakes becomes smaller and the gap distance becomes larger,which results in an increase of the tunneling pathway between adjacent nanoplatelets so the tunnelingresistance increases. In the process of mechanical loading, the tunneling resistance instead of the contactresistance becomes the dominant factor of the resistance. In addition, the more the GNP content, the moreeasily the conductive path gets disrupted by external strains, which results in higher strain sensitivity.Similar results were reported by Lu et al. [38]. They found that the sensitivity of the GNP/epoxy sensorwas varied along with the applied strain and can be separated to three strain regions (0–0.2%), (0.2–0.6%)and (0.6–1.2%), respectively. The gauge factors of the GNP/epoxy sensor with 1.58 vol.% of GNPcorresponding to these three strain regions were 2.53, 3.77 and 4.69, respectively.Table 3.

Normalized resistance change increases with the increase of the strain.Figure 8. Gauge factor for different strain stages.To investigate the stability, reversibility and reliability of the hybrid film sensor, the specimenswere subjected to 200 cyclic loading–unloading tests. This test aimed to monitor the electric resistanceresponse of the hybrid film under cyclic loading. The dynamic responses of the normalized resistancechange and mechanical strain of hybrid films with 0 wt.% (GNP-0) and 50 wt.% (GNP-50) of GNP areplotted in Figure 10a,b, respectively. It can be observed that there is no obvious change during the 200cycling tests for the hybrid film sensors. This demonstrates that the high durability and stability ofthe hybrid film sensor. Some researchers [39,40] also did the cycle loading–unloading tests for stabilityof the GNP/epoxy sensors, they are stable under certain cycles, but the cycles they tested were as lowas 50 or even several cycles.127Nanomaterials 2018, 8, 786Figure 9.

ConclusionsMWCNT/GNP hybrid films were prepared with the aid of surfactant Triton X-100 and sonicationthrough vacuum filtration process. SEM images show that MWCNTs and GNPs are successfullydeposited to form densely packed film with layered structure. The effect of GNP content rangingfrom 0 to 50 wt.% on the mechanical and electrical properties of the hybrid films were characterizedusing the tensile test and Hall effect measurements, respectively. It can be observed that both the tensilestrength and fracture strain are decreasing with the increase of GNP content. The electrical conductivityis increasing from 47.7 S/cm to 192.6 S/cm as the GNP loading increases from 0 to 50 wt.%. A seriesexperimental tests were conducted to study the piezoresistive behavior and the strain-sensing capabilityof the hybrid film. The gauge factor defined as the ratio of relative change in resistance to appliedstrain was used to characterize the sensitivity of the strain sensor. There are two different linearstrain-sensing stages (0–0.2% and 0.2%–1%) in the resistance of the hybrid film with applied strain.The gauge factor increases from 1.164 to 2.236 as the GNP loading increases from 0 to 50 wt.% inthe strain-sensing range 0–0.2%. Moreover, the repeatability and stability of the strain sensitivity ofthe hybrid film were conformed through the cyclic loading and unloading tests. From the resultsobtained, it is demonstrated that the MWCNT/GNP hybrid film is very suitable for strain sensing.128Nanomaterials 2018, 8, 786Author Contributions: Conceptualization, J.R.H. and S.-C.H.; methodology, J.R.H. and X.X.Y.; validation, S.-C.H.and X.X.Y.; investigation, J.R.H. and M.N.Z.; writing: original draft preparation, J.R.H.; writing: review and editingS.-C.H.Funding: This research was funded by Ministry of Science and Technology of the R.O.C, grant numberMOST 104-2221-E155-057-MY3.Acknowledgments: The authors would like to thank Mr. Yuan-Ming Liang and Wei-Chun Hsu at Yuan ZeUniversity for their assistance of the experimental setup and tests.Conflicts of Interest: The authors declare no conflict of interest.References1.

As elite nanomaterials, cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) derivedfrom natural renewable resources, exhibit excellent physicochemical properties, biodegradabilityand biocompatibility and have attracted tremendous interest nowadays. Their combination withother nanomaterials such as graphene-based materials (GNM) has been revealed to be useful andgenerated new hybrid materials with fascinating physicochemical characteristics and performances.In this context, the review presented herein describes the quickly growing field of a new emerginggeneration of CNC/GNM hybrids, with a focus on strategies for their preparation and most relevantachievements. These hybrids showed great promise in a wide range of applications such as separation,energy storage, electronic, optic, biomedical, catalysis and food packaging. Some basic conceptsand general background on the preparation of CNC and GNM as well as their key features areprovided ahead.Keywords: cellulose nanocrystals; graphene; hybrids; applications1. IntroductionThe excessive consumption of fossil-based resources and resulting environmental problems issuescoupled with the constancy growing global population requests the improvement of living standardand accelerating technology development. It has stimulated and attracted researchers worldwide todevelop a sustainable bio-based alternative that can compete in performance with petroleum-basedproducts expected to be employed in a wide range of applications [1–7]. Cellulose, as the mostabundant bio-based material from the biosphere, has attracted more and more attention in differentfields and could serve as a prominent alternative to the exhaustible fossil resources, owing to itsrenewability, biodegradability, biocompatibility, non-toxicity and environmental friendliness [8–12].The advantages of cellulose can be also pushed forward through the exploration of its nonmetric size,which generates nanocellulose (NC), considered as a promising class for future materials due to itsoutstanding physicochemical properties [13–16]. NC displays low density, specific barrier propertiesNanomaterials 2020, 10, 1523; doi:10.3390/nano10081523 www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials133Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 1523and low thermal expansion coefficient, high strength, excellent stiffness, elongation morphology,inertness, large surface area and aspect ratio, abundance and ease of bio-conjugation [11,17–19].The presence of several reactive chemical groups on its surface allows it to be modified by physicaladsorption, covalent bonding or surface grafting to further extend its performance [20]. Researchactivities concerning NC had attracted growing interest over the past decade as reflected by the rapidincrease of scientific publications and patents granted internationally [21]. According to Markets andMarkets, the NC market is forecasted to achieve USD 783 Million by 2025 [13] and thus, NC productionwill have a high economic impact [22]. Moreover, an interesting review has been recently publishedby Charreau et al. dealing with the analysis of the evolution of patents involving nanocellulose since2010 [23], demonstrating the increasing industrial interest in the this, which enabled the setting-up ofthe first facilities producing commercial quantities of NC.Numerous nanocellulose types with outstanding features can be produced from different cellulosicsources employing various approaches [17,24–26]. NC can be divided into two main categories,that is, nanostructured materials (cellulose microfibrils and microcrystalline cellulose) and nanofibers(cellulose nanocrystals, cellulose nanofibrils and bacterial cellulose) [13]. Due to their excellent inherentcharacteristics, cellulose nanocrystals (CNC), as a subclass of NC, is commonly produced from cellulosicfibers and fibrils after the elimination of the amorphous regions by acid hydrolysis [23,27,28]. CNC havearoused wide scientific and technological interest from both academicians and industrials and canbe utilized as an independent functional material, template support, stabilizer, filler or reinforcingagent [29–31]. CNC-based nanomaterials have been extensively investigated due to their uniquephysicochemical, mechanical, thermal, rheological and optical features. CNC could confer excellentproperties to hybrids or nanocomposites (metallic, ceramics and polymeric) even at low concentration fordifferent applications such as medical, pharmaceutics, catalysis, oil/water separation, decontamination,flame retardancy, electronic and optical devices, energy storage, sportswear, light weight armor systems,food packaging, to cite a few [10,11,13,14,20,32–39].The combination of CNC and nanocarbons, such as fullerenes, nanotubes (single-walled, double-walled, few-walled or multi-walled), nanodiamonds and graphene-based materials (graphene, grapheneoxide, reduced graphene oxide, graphene quantum dots), has recently emerged as a new class of hybridmaterials for which a synergetic effect has been revealed in a wide range of applications, spanning fromsensing and biosensing to catalysis, photonics and optics, energy and environment, water treatment,medical and optoelectronics. Other nanocarbons such as carbon black, activated carbon, carbon quantumdots and carbon nanofibers are less frequently used as CN-based hybrids [12,20,40–43].Graphene-based nanomaterials (GNM), which have been considered as emerging and high efficienttwo-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials, play a crucial role in various research area since the discoveryof graphene in 2004 [44,45]. They find applications in several fields such as thin-film transistors,ultra-sensitive chemical sensors and transparent conductive films, biomedical, microelectronics,composites, among others [46–49]. Recent investigations by Yang et al. provided general reviews ofthe whole graphene patenting activities and especially focused on the study of sustainable competitiveadvantages in the biomedical field [50,51]. A comprehensive review dealing with graphene, its relatedmaterials and properties have also been published [52]. Although the present development of industrial-scale graphene is still widely at the Research and Development (R&D) stage, the global graphenemarket reached ca. USD 78.7 million in 2019, with the request in nanocomposites, energy storagematerials and semiconductor electronics, which are also underpinning future growth rate estimatesof >30% per year and expected to reach >USD 221.4 million by 2025 [53,54]. Nowadays, grapheneoxide (GO) materials account for >30% of the global graphene market share as progresses in GO,permitting for numerous of possibly scalable approaches to reach mass production of chemicallymodified graphene with a wide range of applications [54,55]. However, despite that many technicallyfeasible approaches are currently being developed to produce efficient GNM, there are still numerouspractical obstacles that need to be overcome. For instance, GNM are more frequently produced fromaqueous dispersions but can easily aggregate. Such agglomeration behavior can reduce the surface area134Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 1523and negatively impact the mechanical, electrical and optical properties. Therefore, the incorporationof CNC not only surpasses such drawback through its excellent dispersive features but also confersfurther benefits to the produced GNM/CNC hybrids such as flexibility, stretchability, in addition to theimprovement of the adsorption capacity, photothermal activity, stability, intrinsic luminescence andfluorescence, optical transparency and thermal conductivity [36,40,42,56].Owing to the benefits of CNC and GNM materials as well as the numerous research workspublished during the last few years worldwide, a timely update on recent advancements in the fieldof CNC/GNM hybrid-based materials is an urgent need for both academic and industrial scientists.In this overview, we thoroughly review the recent progress made in the preparation, modification,properties and current applications of CNC/GNM hybrids in various fields. This work highlightsa comprehensive overview with a forward-looking approach on CNC/GNM hybrids for numerousutilizations, which have emerged in the past five years. For the reader’s comfort and to maintainlucidity, first, some of the basic concepts dealing with CNC and GNM, their preparation and featuresto further elucidate their unique attributes, are discussed in brief. We will then focus on state-of-the-artcellulose nanocrystals-graphene based materials, which have mainly emerged since 2015. Few articlesbefore 2015 are succinctly summarized in some sections.2. Cellulose Nanocrystals (CNC)2.1. Fundamental of NanocelluloseCellulose, which was first extracted from wood by Enselme Payen in 1838, is a polysaccharideconsisting of β-1,4-linked anhydroglucopyranoside units, in which every monomer unit is corkscrewedat 180◦ compared to its neighbors [5,57]. The annual production of this abundant biopolymer isestimated to be between 1010 and 1011 tons-per-year. It can be isolated from different sources suchas wood, herbaceous plants, grass, crops and their byproducts, bacterial, algae and animal sources,among others [58–61]. The properties of this biomacromolecule are closely related to the naturalsource, its maturity and origin, pretreatment methods, processing approaches and reaction conditions.Typically, lignocellulosic biomass necessitates the removing of non-cellulosic constituents such asextractives, lignin and hemicellulose [62]. Trache et al. have recently reviewed the common pretreatmentand processing methodologies, which allow the obtaining of pure cellulose from lignocellulosic [13].As depicted in Figure 1, cellulose is semi-crystalline in nature, hence it contains both crystallineand amorphous regions. This latter is susceptible to hydrolysis; it can steadily be eliminated togenerate crystalline parts upon phase segregation and is more prone to react with other moleculargroups [57,63,64]. The intra- and intermolecular chemical groups (Figure 1) confer to this fascinatingpolymer its specific features such as infusibility, chirality, hydrophilicity, insolubility in several aqueousmedia and ease of chemical functionalization [65]. Cellulose can be classified into various polymorphs,that is, cellulose I, II, IIII, IIIII, IVI and IVII, which can be converted from one form to another throughchemical or thermal treatments [42].In their nano-size form, cellulose nanomaterials, also known as nanocellulose (NC), displayoutstanding physical, chemical, biological, magnetic, electrical and optical characteristics compared tothe bulk materials [1,11,66]. Conceptually, NC can be produced by a top-down hydrolysis methodologythrough different steps, that is, (i) pretreatment processes of lignocellulosic biomass employingphysical approaches concerning crushing, screening, washing and cooking to eliminate coarse particles,oily content and dust from the material surface, (ii) removing extractive/hemicellulose/lignin viachemical, physical, physicochemical, biological or the combination of two or more treatments,(iii) fragmentation and cleavage of cellulosic elementary fibrils or micro-fibrils to generate nanofibersthrough various approaches and (iv) post-treatments such as solvent removing, dialysis, sonication,centrifugation, surface modification, stabilization and drying. The three latter steps have received greatinterest from the scientific community for designing products with desired features [12,13,23,27,38,67–73].NC possesses excellent useful properties such as renewability, eco-friendliness, biocompatibility,135Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 1523non-toxicity, hydrogen-bonding capacity, tunable crystallinity, high chemical resistance, tailoredaspect ratios (100–150), low thermal expansion coefficient, reactive surface, low density (1.6 g/cm3),high specific surface area (100–200 of m2/g), high tensile strength (7.5–7.7 GPa) and elastic modulus(130–150 GPa) [10,30]. This promising polysaccharide has received tremendous attention duringthe last two decades in a wide range of applications such as sensors and biosensors, energystorage systems, oil and gas drilling and cementing, papermaking, filtration, decontamination,adsorption, separation, wood adhesives, Pickering emulsifiers, medical and nanocomposites, to citea few [13,14,16,20,35,36,42,74–76]. Depending on the isolation method, morphology and size, NC isprincipally categorized into: (i) cellulose nanostructured materials such as cellulose microfibrils andmicrocrystalline cellulose and (ii) cellulose nano-objects, also known as nanofibers, such as cellulosenanocrystals (CNC), cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) and bacterial nanocellulose (BC).

Copyright©2019, Elsevier.In contrast to nanostructured materials, nanofibers present more uniform particle size distribution,high specific surface area, amphiphilic nature, barrier properties, high crystallinity and tend toproduce more stable self-assembled structures such as hydrogels and films [1,30,77]. In recent years,other types of nanofibers appeared such as amorphous nanocellulose, cellulose nanoyarn and cellulosenanoplatelets [17]. Several in-depth reviews with detailed discussions dealing with NC-based materialshave been reported over the past few years, covering the nanocellulose sources, isolation methods,structure modification, potential uses, advantages and shortcomings [11,16,20,23,35,36,38,40,41,78–83].In the following, we concisely go through current extraction methods of CNC and describe theiroutstanding features.2.2. Extraction and Properties of CNCCNC can be often obtained from different types of lignocellulose through a top-down hydrolysisapproach by combining various procedures [9,17,23,84,85]. To extract pure cellulose (PC) throughthe elimination of extractives, lignins and hemicelluloses, some pretreatments (chemical, physical,physicochemical, biological or their combination) of the natural source are usually required [13,34,86].Specific treatments can be then applied to PC to produce CNC through the removing of disorderedregions from pristine cellulose. The crystalline domains remain intact because of their higher resistanceto the hydrolytic action, whereas the amorphous parts dispersed as chain dislocations on segments along136Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 1523the cellulose fibrils are more susceptible to the hydrolysis process [19,78,82]. Afterwards, the elementaryfibrils are transversely cleaved, producing short CNC with somewhat high crystallinity. Nonetheless,after this process, extra post-treatments such as solvent removing, sonication, fractionation, dialysis,centrifugation, filtration, washing, stabilization, surface modification, neutralization and drying arerequired to recover CNC product.The most common hydrolysis method used to produce CNC relies on sulfuric acid, which canreact with the surface hydroxyl groups of pristine cellulose through an esterification process, allowingthe grafting of anionic ester groups [77,87]. This latter generates a negative electrostatic layer thatcovers nanocrystals, promoting the dispersion of CNC in water but reducing their thermal stability.Recently, as an alternative to sulfuric acid hydrolysis, other liquid inorganic acids such as nitric,hydrobromic, phosphoric and hydrochloric have been extensively reported [11,30]. The preparation ofCNC from wood, for which the hydrolysis process causes preferential digestion of the amorphous partof cellulose while the ordered regions remain intact, is schematized in Figure 2. Both natural sourceand experimental conditions (acid concentration, reaction time, temperature, mass ratio, etc.) mayinfluence the characteristic of the prepared CNC such as crystallinity, dimensional dispersity, thermalbehavior, mechanical properties, density, aspect ratio and morphology. Although the hydrolysisprocess using mineral acids is simple and not time-consuming, certain drawbacks such as lower yield,high amount of water usage, severe environmental pollution and harsh corrosion of equipment shouldbe overcome [30]. Therefore, to address the above issues, various recent procedures such as organic acid(oxalic, formic, etc.) hydrolysis [88], solid acid (phosphotungstic) [89], subcritical water hydrolysis [90],deep eutectic solvents [91], ionic liquids [92], oxidation [93], sonication [94], enzymatic [95] andcombined approaches [5,17,31] have been applied and others continue to be developed worldwide toproduce CNC with desired properties at lower costs and higher yield based on sustainability principleand environmentally friendly policy [5,13,17,31]. Nevertheless, scaling-up from laboratory to industrialscale remains one of the most important issues and considerable efforts should be made to prevailover the remaining constraints. Otherwise, some companies such as CelluForce and Alberta Innovates,among others, produce CNC at large scale [13,96].CNC present unique features compared to the other classes of NC with the spotlight to characteristicssuch as physical, chemical, optical, thermal, mechanical, electrical properties [1]. CNC consist of anelongated, needle or rod-like nanoparticles. They are 4–70 nm in width and 100–6000 nm in length andaspect ratio of 5–70, as well as large surface area (150–500 m2·g−1), which allows it to be easily dispersedin water to generate a chiral nematic organization [13,16,97]. CNC also exhibit high crystallinity(50%–90%), a tensile strength of up to 7.5 GPa, a Young’s modulus of ~170 GPa and a bendingstrength of about 10 GPa [9,13,68]. They also display good thermal stability up to 200 ◦C and can findapplications in processes like thermoplastics [97]. Nevertheless, these features depend closely on thesource of feedstock, extraction methods and experimental conditions, which will ultimately definetheir applicability [98].It is worthy to note that the abundance of –OH or other reactive chemical groups and thehigh surface area to volume ratio render CNC highly reactive and easy to be functionalized [100].Therefore, to improve their compatibility and ensure a good dispersion, CNC surface can be chemically,physically or enzymatically modified to impart stable negative or positive electrostatic charges on theirsurface [13,101]. Such modifications may allow tailoring the properties of the CNC-based materialsdepending on the intended application.137Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 1523Figure 2.

Nomenclature and Fundamental AspectsGraphene, discovered by Geim and Novoselov in 2004, is relatively a new two dimensional (2D)sheet-like material in which a honeycomb or hexagonal structure with a flat lattice configuration, completelycomposed of sp2 hybridized carbon atoms that are covalently bound, is densely packed [102,103]. Graphene,an atomic layer of graphite, is the unique carbon’s allotrope, where each atom is tightly linked to itsneighbors by an only electronic cloud in which a C–C bond distance is 0.142 nm [104]. It is considered as afundamental basis for all carbon allotropes and as the mother of a graphitic family for all the dimensions.Graphene-based nanomaterials (GNMs), the first materials reported as examples of 2D nanocarbons,can be classified based on the number of sheet layers, surface modifications, total oxygen contentor orientation [105]. Graphene is highly hydrophobic and is prone to agglomeration, owing to thestrong van der Waals’ interactions between the 2D graphene sheets, leading to low surface area andineffective use of its outstanding features [106]. These latter are also closely dependent on the grapheneavailability as a single layer because if the layers are in close vicinity to each other, they are likely torestack or agglomerate due to π–π interactions. Hence, its functionalization is commonly requiredto surpass these issues. Typically, three types of functionalization approaches through covalent(nucleophilic substitution, electrophilic substitution, condensation and addition), noncovalent (π–πbonding, electrostatic attraction and hydrogen bonding, etc.) or a combination of both interactionscan be used, where the aromaticity of graphene can be either lost or preserved [107]. As shown inFigure 3a–e, GNMs can be found in various forms for which the most important ones that will be thefocus of the present review are graphene nanosheets (GNS), graphene nanoplatelets (GNP), graphene138Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 1523oxide (GO), reduced graphene oxide (RGO) and graphene and graphene oxide quantum dots (GQD).In the frame of the present review, the acronym GN will encompass GNS and GNP.

Copyright©2019, Elsevier.139Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 1523Graphene oxide (GO), commonly prepared from the oxidation of graphite, consists of a few- or asingle-layer sheet. GO sheets are rich in various oxygen-containing groups such as hydroxyl, epoxy,carboxyl, carbonyl, phenol, lactone and quinone, which can change the van der Waals interactions.The two former chemical groups are mostly present on the basal plane, whereas the others withsmall quantities are found at the sheet edges. These functional groups in GO can deeply influenceits electrochemical, mechanical and electronic features. Despite the aromaticity of graphene islost in GO, owing to exploitation of π electrons in the covalent bonding of these oxy groups ongraphene backbone, the carbonyl, carboxyl and so forth groups at the edge render them moredispersible in both organic solvents and water [44,107]. The hydrophobic aromatic frameworks and thehydrophilic oxygen-containing groups make GO amphiphilic, allowing its interaction with inorganicand organic molecules.Reduced graphene oxide (RGO), obtained by the reduction of GO [109], contains fewer oxygenatoms, hence, is less negatively charged [106]. During the reduction, RGO recovers the graphiticarrangements (partial recuperation of the sp2 from sp3 hybridization of GO) through the eliminationof the oxygen-containing groups, which have been inserted in the oxidation step, thus, restoring theelectronic properties of graphene [110]. This partial reduction and the exposure to some chemicalsallow tailoring the conductivity, band-gap and optical features of the material [111,112].Graphene quantum dots (GQDs), which can be found as single- or multiple layers, displayinteresting features such as good chemical stability, high surface area, tunable physical characteristics,stable photoluminescence and low toxicity [113,114]. They can be used in optoelectronic, electronic,biomedical, sensors and energy storage. They usually consist of up to 10 layers of 10–60 nm size RGO [46].Graphene-based nanomaterials possess exceptional electrical, optical, mechanical, electrochemicaland thermal features that make them versatile for a wide range of applications and have drawn worldwideattention in both academic and engineering fields [44,105]. They can be employed in industrial applicationssuch as biomedical, solar cells, biosensors, supercapacitors, electromagnetic absorbers, optical devices,integrated circuit, protective coatings, organic light-emitting diodes, sound transducers, petroleum industry,automobile components, aerospace, energy storage, nanocomposites and contamination purification inwastewater management, to cite a few (Figure 3f) [107,115,116].3.2. Synthesis Routes and PropertiesGraphene can be produced from various sources such as graphitic, non-graphitic and wastematerials using top-down or bottom-up approaches [117–120]. The common routes for its fabricationare summarized in Figure 4. The top-down synthesis routes encompass mechanical exfoliation, liquidphase-exfoliation (LPE), oxidative exfoliation-reduction, arc discharge, unzipping of carbon nanotubes,for which larger precursors such as carbon-based materials or graphite are destroyed to produce a single-,bi- and few-layer graphene. Broadly, some of these approaches can generate high-quality productsand are likely scalable. Nevertheless, they provide limited yield and have complications in makingnanomaterials with reliable characteristics, which are closely dependent on the carbon precursor. On theother hand, the bottom-up synthetic routes could produce graphene using atomic-sized precursors.These approaches comprise epitaxial growth, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), total organic synthesis,template route and substrate-free gas-phase synthesis. Despite the quality of the produced graphene isbetter than that generated using top-down methods, they often require advanced operational setup,high fabrication costs and are energy-consuming. Further advantages and the shortcomings of themost important methods have been reported elsewhere [117,118].140Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 1523 Figure 4. Production techniques of graphene materials. Reproduced with permission from Reference [119].Licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/).It is worthy to note that most of the studies have not usually utilized graphene in its pristine form,because of its lower yield from the production point of view. Therefore, its derivatives have receivedmuch attention. GO is commonly prepared using a chemical oxidation process of graphite withsubsequent dispersion and exfoliation in a suitable solvent (e.g., water). Graphene oxide sheets canalso be fabricated using a modified Hummers’ method, which is described in several reports [121,122].The oxidation processes can lead to fragmentation, crack, winkle, structure disorder, impurities anddefects that may influence the adsorption, optical and electronic characteristics of GO. RGO, however,is usually produced by reducing graphene oxide employing different ways such as chemical, thermal,photocatalytic and electrochemical reductions [123]. Nonetheless, the obtained RGO may containsome impurities with the presence of structural defects. Besides that, the production strategies ofGQDs comprise solvothermal, microwave, CVD and soft template processes, in-situ reduction ofGO, electrochemical fabrication, chemical synthesis and electron beam lithography [113,114,124].Among them, top-down approaches have been proved to be the most appropriate and cost-effectivemethods [46]. GQDs exhibit similar features compared to various types of quantum dots (QDs),particularly in the case of inorganic QDs [113].It has been recently revealed that oxidative exfoliation-reduction, liquid-phase exfoliation and CVDare the most interesting production methods, which possess high potential for industrial implementationto produce graphene-based nanomaterials [45]. However, to develop effective synthesis processes ofgraphene and its derivatives, further research activities have to be conducted to improve the quality,yield of the products with tailorable properties using cost-effective, environmentally friendly, reliableand scalable approaches.The properties of graphene-based materials are closely dependent on the number of layers as wellas the extent of defects. Graphene, as the thinnest carbon material, presents outstanding features suchas higher surface area of ~2630 m2/g compared to GO and other derivatives. It has been reported thata single layer of graphene absorbs 2.3% of white light with a reflectance of less than 0.1%. At roomtemperature, the in-plane thermal conductivity of GN is about 2000–5000 W/m·K. Such dissimilarity isdue to the dissemination of phonons pathway at the surface [46,108]. Some research works reportedthat the charge transporters and carriers mobility of 200,000 cm2/V·s can be reached at electron densitiesof ~2 × 1011 cm−2 [108]. GN possesses good chemical stability and quantum Hall effect at ordinarytemperature, intrinsic strength of 130 GPa, Young’s modulus of 1.0 TPa, shear strength of 60 GPaand fracture stress of 97.54 GPa [123]. It is considered as one of the strongest materials ever tested141Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 1523(200 times than steel) [125]. More details about the characterization methods and the properties ofgraphene and its derivatives have been extensively reviewed in recent years [105,123,124,126,127].4. Preparation, Properties and Application of CNC/GNM HybridsCNC has aroused a tremendous amount of interest of the scientific community in recent yearsdue to its outstanding features and can be employed as an independent functional material, templatesupport, stabilizer, filler or reinforcing agent. Recently, it has been combined with numerous GNMssuch as GN [128], GO [129], RGO [130], GQDs [131–133], free-standing graphene (FSG) [134] andgraphene nanoscrolls [135] to produce hybrid materials with excellent thermal, mechanical, optical andelectronic properties. However, several scientific and technical issues can be encountered during theproduction of such hybrid materials such as agglomeration, limited dispersion, process scalability andhigh costs, among others. Hence, many research works have been carried out and others continue to beconducted worldwide to overcome these problems and obtaining efficient CNC/GNM for a wide rangeof applications. The emphasis of the following subsections will be dedicated to the most importantapproaches used to produce CNC/GNM hybrids as well as their properties. Specific attention will bededicated to the investigations performed during the last few years.4.1. CNC/GNGN possesses large surface area, exceptional electrocatalytic activity, high mechanical strength,good electronic transport characteristics, excellent optical properties and thermal performance,which has motivated its broad application prospect in several fields such as functional composites,electrochemical sensors and catalysis, among others [136]. To expand the number of applications of GNand enhance its inherent properties, numerous GN composites have been successfully produced andapplied in several fields. Recently, nanocomposites of CNC/GN have attracted widespread attention,owing to their exceptional features and synergetic effects that develop new ways and opportunitiesfor the production, characterization and application of new materials in nanotechnology. It has beenrecently demonstrated that the preparation of CNC/GN can be carried out with and without chemicalfunctionalization for which the water-based dispersion is the common starting approach to producecomposites with/without a combination with various types of materials such as metallic and ceramicnanoparticles or natural and synthetic polymers. Several processes can be further applied such asfiltration, hot pressing, deposition and drying to generate a wide range of advanced materials. Thus,such CNC/GN-based materials hold a great promise for several applications ranging from packaging tobiomedical fields. Nevertheless, the optimization of the composite compositions and tailoring of theirproperties can extend the number of applications and reduce the production cost for eventual scalability.Carrasco at al. have employed CNC as an effective graphene stabilizer in aqueous dispersion at highconcentration for which the exfoliation of graphite to generate graphene flakes has been carried out usinga tip sonication [137]. Such an approach based on CNC-assisted liquid-phase exfoliation (LPE) producedgraphene flakes decorated with CNC stabilizers with interesting properties. The authors proved thatsuch hybrids could be employed in different applications such as composites and supercapacitors.In another study by Cui et al. an interesting efficient one-step mechanical-chemical method to in-situproduce CNC/GN hybrid, with rigid 2D structure and improved interfacial interactions, from microfibrillated cellulose and graphite using ball milling has been developed [138]. A schematic illustrationof the composite preparation is given in Figure 5A. This hybrid was successfully dispersed withinpoly(propylene carbonate) (PPC) with strong interfacial interactions which can increase its glasstransition temperature (Tg) and enhance its mechanical and electrical features for practical uses.The obtained PPC/CNC/GN composite displayed a Tg of 51.3 ◦C, which is higher than that of purePPC (34.0 ◦C). The percolation threshold considerably decreased from 15 to 5 wt.%, whereas the tensilestrength and the Young’s modulus reached 52.8 MPa and 731.2 MPa, respectively.142Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 1523Figure 5.

Licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 InternationalLicense (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/).Montes et al. have recently demonstrated the existence of a synergetic reinforcement of poly(vinylalcohol) (PVA) nanocomposites with CNC-stabilized graphene [144]. They produced CNC/GN hybridusing a CNC-assisted LPE that allows the stabilization of the resulting GN in aqueous dispersion.Such hybrid was incorporated into a PVA aqueous solution by a direct blending to obtain a nanocompositeafter casting evaporation. It was mentioned that the thermal stability of the composite is improvedthrough the addition of 1 wt.% of CNC/GN hybrid nanofiller. Moreover, the mechanical featureshave been also enhanced compared to the neat PVA (20% improvement in tensile strength and 50% inYoung’s modulus). It was claimed that CNC played a dual role, where it acts as GN stabilizer andPVA reinforcement. Moreover, the synergetic effect of CNC/GN hybrid is notable, where interestingthermal, mechanical and electrical features can be attained through the tailoring of the nanofillerloading. Recently, this research group has studied the effect of CCN/GN hybrid on the properties ofpoly(lactic acid) (PLA) based film [145]. The composite was prepared using a melt blending method,a conventional technique for plastic compounding, at a total loading of 1wt.% and then processed by143Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 1523hot pressing to generate the film. Compared to the baseline, the film PLA/CNC/GN exhibited highthermal stability and better mechanical features with an increase of 11 and 8% in the tensile strengthand Young’s modulus, respectively. The investigation of the gas barrier properties as well as theantifungal activity of the prepared film revealed significant improvements, which make it a potentialcandidate in food packaging trays and agricultural film applications.A few years ago, an interesting composite based on soy protein isolate (SBI) and CNC/GN has beendeveloped by Li et al. as food packaging material [139]. A schematic presentation of the nanocompositepreparation is shown in Figure 5B. The authors exploited the high aspect ratio of 1D CNC with the flexibleand strength 2D GN to manufacturing active interfacial adhesion laminate nanocomposites. To obtaina stable aqueous graphene dispersion via sonication, the negatively charged sulfate ester groups ofCNC were firstly modified through the incorporation of positively charged surface functionalitiesusing the cationic polyethyleneimine. Such modification enhanced the strong ionic interactions withnegatively charged GN for efficient dispersion and later-by-layer assembly with SBI. The obtainedcomposite film displayed interesting mechanical features and improved surface hydrophobicity forwhich the tensile strength increased from 3.75 to 7.49 MPa and the water contact angle augmentedfrom 39◦ to 54◦ compared to the control film. Better thermal stability, water resistance and UV-visiblelight barrier ability were also exhibited by such composite film, making it a potential candidate as foodpackaging material.Valentini et al. produced polymer solar cells using optically transparent conductive GN andCNC film [146]. They reported that the mixture containing 10 mL of CNC suspension (0.5 wt.%) and10 mL of GN solution (1 wt.%), which was prepared in an ultrasonic bath at room temperature for20 min and evaporated under a nitrogen stream, was the best composition. The obtained NG/CNClayer, which has a low surface roughness, was optically transparent and enabled light to go through.The measurement of the contact angle of GN/CNC demonstrated a lower contact angle value whencompared to those of the neat glass or CNC film, which was assigned to the flatter surface morphologyof the GN/CNC film. These authors produced a photovoltaic device by spin coating. The thicknessof the spin-cast photosensitive layer was about 100 nm, as determined by atomic force microscopy.The manufactured polymer solar cell reached a higher short-circuit current density value, revealingits improved electron blocking action. The enhanced mechanical properties, the optical transparencyas well as the electrical conductivity of the hybrid layer will certainly allow the development of thenext generation of flexible and foldable printed optoelectronic devices. In another work, Wang et al.combined GN and CNC to produce flexible, electrically and thermally conductive hybrid thin filmusing a water-based approach and vacuum filtration [140]. Figure 5C shows the transmission electronmicroscopy (TEM) and optical micrographs of the obtained GN of about 15 layers as well as CNC/GNsolution, revealing that GN was uniform without the appearance on any segregation after mixing withhydrophilic CNC. The better particle alignment with the removing of the internal pores was promotedby the use of the hot-press process. It was found that the hot-pressed 25 wt.% CNC hybrid paperexhibited interesting mechanical features for which the modulus was improved by 57% and tensilestrength by 33% with respect to the neat GN paper. The electrical conductivity was negatively affectedby the increase of the amount of CNC and the optimum CNC loading was 15%. Such hybrids can findapplication in heat and electrical-conducting fields.The employment of CNC/GN hybrid as a supporting material to produce supported metalcatalysts, which can be used as dispersing, capping or reducing agents, using a clean, simple andeffective process has been reported. Wang et al. have deposited mono-dispersed gold nanoparticles(Au NPs) on multifunctional CNCN/GN hybrid sheets to generate catalysts with efficient catalyticactivity, flexibility and stability [141]. The production procedure is briefly illustrated in Figure 5D.The hybrid structure allowed the reduction, growth and immobilization of Au NPs. The OH-groups ofCNC coordinated with GN permitted creating narrow nanosized Au NPs anchored onto the surfaceof the hybrid through the in-situ reduction of Au3+. Such a catalyst has been revealed to be effectivefor one-pot reaction of an alkyne, an amine and an aldehyde in water since it can minimize the144Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 1523environmental pollutions caused by heavy metallic ions and organic solvents. It can be reused forseveral times without significant deactivation. It is also expected to be employed in a wide range ofapplications such as energy storage and catalysis.On the other hand, stimuli-responsive hydrogels, such as 3D polymeric networks, are consideredprominent intelligent drug delivery systems to selectively release the drug at the desired sites.The emerging of CNC/GN hybrids has pushed the scientific community to develop a new generationof efficient hydrogels. Omidi et al. have successfully developed a pH-responsive hydrogel containingaminated CNC (WN), aminated graphene (GN) and chitosan via Schiff base reaction by a syntheticdialdehyde in a few minutes [142]. The preparation procedure is schematized in Figure 5E. The preparedhydrogel exhibited better sensitivity to different external stimuli encompassing pH and amino acids.More specifically, it displayed a pH-responsive release behavior for anticancer drugs. Also, the hydrogelpresented strong antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria, revealing the efficiency of suchhydrogel as a potential candidate for the localized drug delivery systems.To extend the application of CNC/GN hybrids as anti-static or electromagnetic interferenceshielding materials, Liu et al. have prepared sandwiched films of epoxy resin and GNC/GN paper.Firstly, a hybrid paper of GN containing 10 wt.% of CNC was produced using ultrasonication processin aqueous suspension [147]. This hybrid displayed an electrical conductivity of 16,800 S/m and tensilestrength of 31.3 MPa. To manufacture the sandwiched film of epoxy and CNC/GN, a dip coatingmethod was applied through the introduction of the paper into epoxy resin solution followed by acuring process at ambient temperature. The authors revealed that the moduli of the films were about300 folds and the tensile strength increased by two-folds concerning the pure resin. The glass transitionof the composite increased as well when compared to that of the neat resin. Besides, the coatedCMC/GN hybrid by epoxy resin displayed better dimensionality integrity after sonication in waterfor two hours. In another work, a composite containing water-born polyurethane/CNC/GN has beenrecently prepared through one-step sol process by Yang et al. as a thermosetting coating materialfor wood-based composites, which exhibited better energy-saving characteristics [143]. The betterdispersion of CNC/GN has been optimized as shown in a TEM image in Figure 5F. The propertiesof the prepared composites have been improved through the incorporation of CNC/GN, where thethermal conductivity, abrasion resistance and hardness were enhanced and meanwhile, the coatingadhesion was maintained at an acceptable level. The authors claimed that such findings can promotethe development of wooden heating material with better-energy saving characteristics.In another study, Nie et al. have introduced a small amount of CNC (also named CNWs) toGN (CNWs/GN = 1/20 w/w) to improve its uniform dispersion in a waterborne epoxy polymericmatrix (WEP), which is still challenging at a high GN loading, using a solution-casting approach [148].A schematic illustration of the preparation of the composite is depicted in Figure 6. The obtainedfilm at a GN loading of 1.0 wt.% achieved enhanced mechanical properties with a higher Young’smodulus of 2820 MPa compared to the neat epoxy (2034 MPa). The glass transition of such compositeincreased by 4.3 ◦C when compared to the pure resin. The better dispersion of GN on the surfaceof epoxy owing to the effect of CNWs led to the increase of the water contact angle, confirmingthe improvement of the water-barrier behavior of the composite CNWs/GN/WEP. The authors haveassessed the anticorrosion effectiveness of the prepared coating composite using potentiodynamicpolarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy tools. The results demonstrated that CNWsplayed a double role through improving the dispersion of GN and the corrosion resistance for mild steel.145Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 1523 Figure 6.

CNC/GOGO, as one of the most important derivatives of graphene, contains a high density of oxygen-functional groups, which can allow covalent, ionic or hydrogen interactions with numerous polymericmatrices, paving the way to several technological applications. It displays interesting features such ashigh specific surface area, high binding potential, high hydrophilicity, high dispersibility, superiormechanical properties and surface functional groups that can be employed as attachment sites [149].However, to fully exploit the potential of GO, the production of GO-based composites is significant.Various GO-based nanocomposites have become increasingly mature in several fields. Recently, studieson CNC/GO hybrids have been actively conducted. CNC with outstanding features such as highYoung’s modulus, high crystallinity, high surface chemical activity and tailorable surface characteristicscan offer strong, non-toxic and flexible advanced GO-based hybrids, which further inherit the features ofboth CNC and GO for which desired properties can be obtained. CNC/GO-related material compositeshave been investigated both on their own and after incorporation of other components such asmetals, ceramics or polymers to modulate their final properties for specific uses. These hybrids foundapplications in nano paper, food packaging, biomedical, energy storage, sensors, decontamination,catalysis, adsorption, shape memory devices, foams, fire retardants and insulating materials, to citea few.146Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 1523The aqueous GO solution with CNC is considered the common approach used to prepare CNC/GOcomposites. Kafy et al. have produced CNC/GO film as humidity sensor using this blending method,followed by the drying process [150]. They synthesized CNC using the conventional H2SO4 hydrolysismethod, whereas they produced GO by way of the modified Hummer’s method. Then, they mixed thetwo suspensions at a desired ratio followed by homogenization. After that, the solution was poured ina petri dish and dried. The obtained hybrid exhibited a good dispersion of GO in CNC matrix for whichhigh dielectric constant and low dielectric loss have been revealed, owing to the special polarizationdipoles in CNC. These authors prepared a renewable, flexible and cheap sensor using this hybridand an interdigital transducer patterned electrode deposited on a polyethylene terephthalate (PET)substrate. This sensor displayed a good sensitivity to humidity even under different temperatures.Similarly, Chen et al. produced CNC/GO using an aqueous suspension of CNC with either GOsuspension or GO powder (Figure 7) [151]. The mixing process generated a stable solution for thefirst, whereas a metastable solution was obtained when GO powder was used. The drying processcarried out via vacuum-assisted self-assembly technique (VASA), engendered non-iridescence andiridescence films, respectively, for the hybrids containing GO suspension and GO powder. It is worthyto note that CNC-based iridescent films found applications in optical functional materials. It wasdemonstrated that self-organized film was obtained from stable solution, while the separated structurewas generated from the metastable solution. Interestingly, the later film, which displayed iridescentoptical properties, consisted of self-assembled liquid crystals phase of CNC with embedded GO sheets.The authors claimed that such iridescent hybrid can be applied in security materials, reflective filters,sensors and other photonic materials.

Copyright©2014, The Royal Societyof Chemistry.147Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 1523Although the water-based dispersion is the widely adopted method to produce CNC/GO,it represents an unavoidable issue of the higher resistance. Valentini et al. have developed a methodto produce CNC/GO with reduced electrical resistivity [129]. They employed the same approach ofthe mixing of the CNC suspension with the GO solution but assisted by an external electric field.This latter induced de-oxygenation of GO and hence its conductivity can be recovered to some extent.Such electrical conductivity was rather moderate, because of the presence of CNC as an insulatingmatrix. In a separate work of the same authors, the above approach, which is based on the drop-castingof an aqueous solution of CNC/GO between two metal electrodes, was found to be efficient to producea resistive memory device based on CNC/GO thin hybrid [152]. Such thin film-based device exhibiteda transition between low and high conductivity states upon changing the polarity of the appliedexternal electric field. The authors claimed that such an achievement could promote the developmentof post-silicon electronic devices based on the integration of CNC/GN thin hybrids. Recently, Pan et al.developed a new method to produce chiral smectic structures through self-assembling 2D GO and 1DCNC nanorods [153]. Such a structure is closely dependent on the ratio of nanorods and nanosheets aswell as the concentration of the composite colloid. The authors initially mixed CNC and GO suspensionsat low concentration (<1%) and incorporated cross-linked polyacrylate hydrogel to concentrate theblend suspension. The CNC/GO was recovered by spin-coating of the colloid on PES substrate anddried at 60 ◦C. This method was considered timesaving compared to traditional approaches. It wasdemonstrated that such advancement can pave the way to develop optical metamaterials for opticalmodulation and mechanochromic sensors.It was reported that poor dispersion of reinforcements at the nanoscale in addition to the weakinterfacial interactions can negatively affect the material strength, toughness and other properties.Thus, several physical or chemical modifications can be employed to overcome such issues. In thecase of CNC/GO composites, several approaches have been proposed to improve their efficiency fornumerous applications. The common ones used to enhance the interfacial of such hybrids were basedon the modification of CNC surface features, whereas few modifications have been simultaneouslyapplied to CNC and GO.One of the interesting production methods was that developed by Xiong et al. to manufactureultra-robust transparent CNC/GO membrane with high electrical conductivity [154]. These authorsimproved the interfacial interactions of anionic CNC, prepared by H2SO4 hydrolysis and anionic GOsheets obtained through the modification of CNC with 10 wt.% cationic polyethyleneimine to introducepositive surface charge functionalities. This modification enhanced the ionic interactions between thestrongly positively charged polymer and negatively charged flexible GO, which consequently improvedthe layer-by-layer assembly, carried out on a sacrificial layer of cellulose acetate on a silicon wafer,to design laminated nanohybrids with high flexibility, outstanding mechanical strength, high opticaltransparency along with excellent toughness. The authors claimed that such CNC/GO hybrids could beused for a wide range of technological applications, encompassing wearable electronic devices, biofluidseparation, electromagnetic interference shielding and ballistic protection. The authors also employedthe same approach to produce CNC/RGO hybrids after the electrochemical reduction of the formermembrane [155]. In another work, Kabiri et al. produced acetylated CNC (CNCA), which was furtherused to prepare well dispersed CNCA/GO hybrid by a solvent casting method (Figure 8A) [156]. It wasstipulated that the modification of CNC will promote its interfacial adhesion and miscibility with GOvia hydrogen bonding. It was proved that composite supplemented with 0.8M of GO offered betterthermal stability, interesting mechanical properties with an increase in the tensile strength of 61.92%with respect to CNCA. Moreover, the barrier characteristics against water were improved. The authorsclaimed that such a composite could find potential application in electrical and electrochemical fields.148Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 1523  (A) (B) Figure 8.

Copyright©2019, Elsevier.Recently, Daniyal et al. have prepared hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTA) modifiedCNC/GO thin film and assessed its potential in sensing copper and nickel ions based on surfaceplasmon resonance (SPR) technique [157,158]. The authors initially prepared CTA-CNC solution andthen 0.1 wt.% of GO was dispersed within the solution and sonicated at 70 ◦C for 1 h (Figure 8B).The obtained solution of CTA-CNC/GO was spin-coated and deposited as a thin layer on the glasssubstrate modified with a thin gold film. The authors demonstrated that the presence of CTA improvedthe sensitivity of the SPR. They revealed that the combination of SPR and CTA-CNC/GO has thepotential to be employed as effective sensors, which can detect copper and nickel ions. In anotherresearch work, Beyranvand et al. produced hydrogel based on CNC/GO hybrid as a new adsorbentfor methylene blue. During the preparation, azide-functionalized CNC was synthesized after CNCtosylation [159]. Then CNC-N3/GO was obtained via nitrene chemistry [160]. The production process ofCNC-N3/GO, as well as its mechanism of action, is illustrated in Figure 9. It was demonstrated that theprepared hybrid was an excellent adsorbent of methylene blue owing to the higher adsorption capacity,reasonable contact time and recyclability. More recently, Zheng et al. have synthesized a modifiedCNC/GO hybrid as an efficient adsorbent of Dy (III). The authors used the evaporation-inducedself-assembly (EISA) method to spontaneously form an imprinted film. Beforehand, they carried outan in situ selective oxidation of CNC using 2,2,3,3-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO) for whichC6 hydroxyl group was primarily oxidized to the carboxyl group (-COOH) [161]. It was found thatsuch modification improved the stability of the TEMPO-modified CNC through strong electrostaticrepulsion on one hand and on the other hand, it offered more surface active sites for the adsorption ofDy (III). The latter was further improved by the introduction of GO, which created extra bonding sitesto Dy (III) and enhanced the adsorption capacity of TEMPO-CNC/GO hybrid. These authors reportedthat the developed green hybrid was efficient and had a strong regeneration performance.The preparation and design of molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) is a multidisciplinaryfield, which encompasses various aspects of molecular recognition, biomimetic biology and polymerchemistry. MIPs preparation involves arranging functional monomers around a template, followed bypolymerization with the presence of cross-linkers and a suitable initiator through covalent, semi-covalentor non-covalent intermolecular interactions and finally template removal. Such an approach has beenrecently explored to produce CNC/GO-based composites as molecular imprinted electrochemical sensors,which exhibited outstanding features. For instance, Anirudhan et al. have prepared MIP of silylated GOand chemically modified CNC using a drop cast method for the selective sensing of cholesterol [162].The authors incorporated ZnO to CNC to enhance their conductivity. The electrochemical studieswere carried out using cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry. This sensor achievedgood stability and reproducibility, low detection limit and wide linear range. The optimum pH,equivalent to the blood pH, was 7.4 and the optimum response time was only 10 min. In another work,149Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 1523Wang et al. manufactured a CNC/GO-based MIP for the selective extraction and fat adsorption ofsynthetic antibiotics (fluoroquinolones, FQs), which can accumulate as residues in river water, causinga hazard for living organisms [163]. The preparation process of the magnetic@GO-grafted-CNC@MIPis depicted in Figure 10. It was found that the utilization of CNC and GO as substrates can improvethe properties such as the stability, selectivity and affinity of MIPs compared to the conventional ones.The authors demonstrated that the prepared hybrid displayed an ultra-fast adsorption profile for FQswith high recognition and large detection limit range. They claimed that this method is accurate,effective, sensitive and simple, thereby appropriate for the detection of residual FQs in water sample. Figure 9.

Copyright©2017, Springer.150Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 1523The simultaneous incorporation of CNC and GO to numerous polymers such poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxy valerate) [164], poly-N-isopropyl acrylamide [165], poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) [166], poly(vinylidene fluoride) [167], polyacrylamide [168], poly(ε-caprolactone) [169], polylactic acid [170], poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) [171] and chitosan [172] wasadopted as an efficient method to produce composites with excellent features since these nanofillersoffer outstanding synergetic effects. Some surface modifications can be applied to CNC or GO toimprove their dispersion and compatibility within the polymeric matrices. This type of nanocompositefound a wide range of applications in biosensing [165], plastic masks [172], tissue engineering [168,169],wastewater treatment [167], food packaging [173], supercapacitors [166], to cite a few. For instance,El Miri et al. evaluated the synergetic effect of CNC/GO as a functional hybrid to enhance the propertiesof PVA nanocomposites (Figure 11I). The nanocomposites were prepared via solvent casting method.The authors demonstrated that the tensile strength, toughness and Young’s modulus were respectivelyenhanced by 124%, 159% and 320% compared to the neat PVA. The strong interfacial interactions andthe synergetic effect of 1D elongated CNC and 2D exfoliated GO, which improved the dispersion andavoided the agglomeration of the nanofillers, were also highlighted compared to the incorporationof pure CNC or GO. Such nanocomposite may find application in food packaging materials.In another recent study, Kumar et al. produced hybrid hydrogels containing polyacrylamide-sodiumcarboxymethylcellulose (PMC), GO and CNC via in situ free-radical polymerization (Figure 11II) [168].The obtained composite displayed outstanding mechanical performance, self-healing behavior andshape-recovery feature. The authors claimed that such highly hydrated hybrid hydrogel with tailorableproperties might provide a 3D microenvironment for tissue engineering applications.Figure 11.

CNC/RGOThe production of RGO, which is commonly performed by the exfoliation of pristine graphenefollowed by oxidation and reduction, may generate numerous defects such as grain boundaries,vacancies, Stone-Wales defects and macroscopic defects. These defects not only restrict its productionat the industrial scale but also limit the full exploitation of its outstanding properties. Another obstaclein the practical use of RGO is the formation of irreversible agglomeration caused by the strong vander Waals interactions between graphene planes. Therefore, various attempts were made to reducethese drawbacks through RGO functionalization or incorporation of other additives such as vitaminC, green tea, protein bovine serum albumin and CNC, among others, to improve the propertiesand performance of the final derived nanocomposites and increase the number of its applications inseveral fields [28,173].Nowadays, various unmodified CNC/RGO hybrids were actively explored for differentapplications such as sensors, flexible electronics, supercapacitors and photonic devices [174]. Severalapproaches used to produce some unmodified CNC/RGO hybrids have been reported for whichthe common method used to produce CNC/GO can be applied. Wan Khalid prepared COC/RGOnanocomposite by dispersion/ultrasonication of 1 mg RGO in ethanol and 1 mg of CNC in deionizedwater [175]. The supernatant was eliminated by centrifugation to recover the final hybrid. This latter,re-dispersed in ethanol, was drop-coated onto an electrode surface, which was intended to be used forelectrochemical sensing of methyl paraben. The authors revealed that the obtained sensor exhibited goodstability, reproducibility, selectivity toward methyl paraben and reusability compared to RGO-basedsensor. Similarly, Nan et al. produced iridescent RGO/CNC film with advanced optical properties [176].They prepared a suspension containing 1 wt.% of CNC and RGO floccules, which underwent anultrasound treatment and dried using vacuum-assisted self-assembly (VASA) technique. The obtainedfilms displayed regularly metallic iridescence owing to the homogeneous dispersion of RGO withinthe chiral nematic liquid crystals of CNC. The key factors to tune such behavior were the durationof ultrasonic treatment and the drying process. This iridescent hybrid exhibited better electricalproperties in addition to the reversible change in color during the adsorption/desorption of water.The authors claimed that such a hybrid might find applications in photonic devices and biosensors.Recently, Wang et al. adopted a facile one-pot technique to prepare CNC/GO nanocomposite that wasfollowed by a reduction using L-ascorbic acid to form CNC/RGO conductive paper [177]. The process,compared to the well-known ones, is schematically represented in Figure 12. Briefly, the exfoliation ofgraphite and the hydrolysis of cellulose occurred simultaneously in the reaction system, followed bysubsequent reduction using green L-ascorbic acid. A conductive paper (CP) with high conductivity,excellent mechanical properties and thermal stability was then formed using ultrafiltration. It wasstated that such CP can be used in implantable biosensors, smart textiles and portable micropowerdevices. In another research activity, Chen et al. proposed a new method to produce CNC/RGO hybrid,which was based on non-liquid-crystal spinning followed by a reduction using hydrogen iodide(HI), as schematized in Figure 13 [130]. The authors revealed that the incorporation of an alkalinemedia during the dispersion of CNC/RGO caused the electrostatic repulsion between CNC and GOsheets, leading to weaker hydrogen-bonding interaction and rendering the flowing process duringspinning more homogeneous and easier. The authors demonstrated that the strength of RGO/CNChybrid (230.6 MPa) was improved compared to pure RGO (157.5 Mpa). The hydrophilicity of thehybrid was also improved in addition to the high capacitive performance and conductivity. After that,such a hybrid was immersed in a polyvinyl alcohol acidic solution to fabricate flexible all-solid-statesupercapacitor. The assembled supercapacitor achieved excellent bending stability, better flexibility,high energy density (5.1 mW h cm−3) and power density (496.4 mW cm−3). The authors claimed thatthe prepared hybrid easily meets the requirements of flexible or even wearable supercapacitor.152Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 1523Figure 12.

Schematic illustration of the preparation of CNC/RGO hybrid fiber. Reproduced withpermission from Reference [130]. Copyright©2018, Elsevier.To further extend the number of applications, improve the different properties of CNC/RGOhybrids as well as their efficiency, numerous modifications of either CNC, RGO or both of them havebeen recently assessed. For instance, Zhao et al. produced electro-conductive nanocomposite basedon CNC and TiO2-RGO. Firstly, GO prepared by the modified Hummers method was subjected tothe photocatalytic reduction via TiO2. The obtained TiO2-RGO suspension was mixed with CNCsuspension under ultrasonication. CNC/TiO2-RGO was then vacuum-filtered and dried. The obtainedflexible transparent hybrid displayed improved electro-conductivity (9.3 S/m) with enhanced elasticmodulus (3998 MPa) and tensile strength (18.1 MPa), stipulating that it can be used as a transparentflexible substrate for future electronic devices. In another work, Zhang et al. demonstrated the feasibilityof the spinning of conductive filaments from oppositely charged nano-species, that is, cationic CNC andanionic RGO using interfacial nanoparticle complexation [178]. Initially, 2,3 dialdehyde cellulose wasprepared by periodate oxidation, subjected to cationization with Girard’s reagent or aminoguanidinehydrochloride and passed through the double-chamber system of a microfluidizer to form cationicCNC. Droplets of aqueous suspensions (cationic CNC and anionic GN), placed adjacent to each other,generated continuous CNC/GO filaments, as shown in Figure 14. These latter were immersed intohydrogen iodide solution, washed and dried, to afford CNC/RGO hybrid filaments. These hybridsdisplayed an electrical conductivity of 3298 ± 167 S/m and tensile strength of 190.3 ± 8 MPa.153Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 1523 Figure 14. (a) suspensions of cationic CNC and GO and a dual precipitated complex after simplemixing; (b–e) CNC/GO hybrid filament drawing process; (f) a single dried CNC/GO hybrid filamentwith a diameter of ~33 μm and a length of 53 cm; (g) a scheme illustrating the CNC/GO hybrid filamentdrawing process.

Licensed under a CreativeCommons Attribution 3.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/).Kabiri and Namari described another interesting process for the preparation of CNC/RGO hybrid.They functionalized RGO with CNC via “click” coupling between terminated propargyl-functionalizedCNC (PG-CNC) and azide-functionalized GO (GO-N3) [179]. After the surface azidation of GO,the “click” reaction between GO-N3 and PG-CNC, already synthesized by the Peng method [180],was performed using copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition. The reduction of the finalnanocomposite dispersed in deionized water under sonication was carried out using hydrazine at70 ◦C. The obtained free-dried CNC/RGO hybrid exhibited interesting physicochemical properties andthermal stability. In another study done by Sadasivyni et al., a transparent and eco-friendly CNC/RGOfilm for proximity sensing was developed [181]. The authors employed layer-by-layer spraying ofmodified CNC/GO nanocomposite, which was obtained as detailed in Figure 15, on lithographicpatterns of interdigitated electrodes on polymer substrates. The modified nanocomposite was reducedusing anhydrous hydrazine at 80 ◦C to generate a hydrophobic CNC/RGO hybrid. The obtainedsensitive sensor allowed detecting a human finger interface within a distance of 6 mm with interestingresponse and recovery time interval. This sensor has potential to be used in various applications suchas robotics, punching machines, smart phones, electronics and optoelectronics.On the other hand, several CNC/RGO-based polymer composites have been produced and assessedin several applications such as sensors, scaffolds in tissue engineering, food and drug packaging.The polymeric matrices tested include polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC) [173], natural rubber (NR) [182],polyethylene oxide [183], poly-lactic acid (PLA) [184,185] and polyamide 6 [186]. It was demonstrated thatthe incorporation of CNC/RGO conferred to the polymeric nanocomposites outstanding mechanical andthermal properties, interesting barrier features, low toxicity, high conductivity and so forth [183,184,186].For instance, Cao et al. prepared a 3D interconnected CNC/RGO/NR network using a latex assemblymethod for which NR latex was incorporated into a CNC/RGO suspension [182]. The solid formedthrough the co-coagulation induced by an acidic solution was vacuum filtered. A schematic illustrationof the process is provided in Figure 16. The obtained conductive structure displayed higher electricconductivity and better mechanical features with superior resistivity responses for organic liquids.Such nanocomposite can find application in sensing to discriminate various solvents leakage inchemical industries and environmental monitoring.154Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 1523 Figure 15.

Schematic presentation of the synthesis of CNC/RGO/NR nanocomposite. Reproduced withpermission from Reference [182]. Copyright©2016, Elsevier.155Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 1523In other research, Pal et al. assessed the combined effect of CNC and RGO in PLA nanocompositeas a scaffold in tissue engineering [185]. They initially prepared CNC and RGO via acid hydrolysis andmodified Hummer’s method, respectively and then employed a solution casting approach to produceCNC/RGO/PLA hybrid. The detailed preparation procedure is schematized in Figure 17. Compared topristine PLA, the developed hydrophilic hybrid film revealed higher thermal stability, significantlyincreased tensile strength up to 23% with and enhancement in elongation at break, showing its ductilebehavior. Moreover, the antibacterial activity against both Gram-negative Escherichia coli (E. coli) andGram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) bacterial strains was highlighted. The in-vitro cytotoxicityassay indicated the non-toxicity of the nanocomposite film toward fibroblast cell line (NIH-3T3) aswell. More recently, interesting research has been conducted by You et al. [173], who introduced thehybrid CNC/RGO to the solution of PVDC (Figure 18). The precipitated sample was vacuum dried toproduce the CNCN/RGO/PVDC nanocomposite. The transparency of the CNC/RGO/PVDC coated onPET substrate was determined as 84% at 550 nm wavelength by UV–visible spectrometer in the regulartransmission mode (Figure 18). It was proved that the utilization of stable dispersion of CNC/RGOenabled the fabrication of optically clear and thermostable nanohybrid film with improved barriercharacteristics against water and oxygen. The authors claimed that the developed approach to produceCNCN/RGO/PVDC nanocomposite was effective and the obtained hybrid film is considered a potentialcandidate for food and drug packaging.

Summary and OutlookDuring the last decade, significant advances have been made in the preparation, characterizationand application of CNC/GNM hybrids. This article is a brief review of this fast-growing research areaand intended to highlight the up-to-date studies and utilization of CNC/GNM hybrids. Firstly, we haveintroduced some basic concepts of nanocellulose and GNM, then summarized their preparation methodsand properties, with a particular focus on their outstanding features to elucidate their unique attributes.The different preparation processes of CNC/GNM have been discussed as well as their properties.Furthermore, to well understand the characteristics of theses hybrids, their different applications havebeen provided.CNC/GNM hybrid-based materials displayed interesting innovative features due to synergeticeffects, which are unachievable by taking CNC and GNM materials separately. It is shown that thecombination of the diversity and specificity of both CNC and GNM not only expands the number ofapplications but also has indisputable advantages to benefit their unique attributes. These hybridshold a cornucopia of favorable properties that warrant their employment in the fields of sensing,catalysis, separation, electronics, optics, biomedical, energy storage, to name a few. Nonetheless,the development of CNC/GNM hybrid-based materials is relatively a new concept, which is mostlylimited to academic discipline but is expected that CNC/GNM hybrids will certainly be commerciallyavailable in the future, which will attract more research attention not only in various applications butalso to achieve multifunctional multi-systems and open new perspectives. Moreover, the practicalapplication of such hybrids as next-generation materials requires further improvements in functionalityand performance in addition to the reduction of the production costs and the environmental impacts.157Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 1523Author Contributions: Conceptualization, D.T.; Methodology, D.T.; Investigation, D.T.; Resources, D.T.; Writing—original draft preparation, D.T., V.K.T. and R.B.; Writing-review and editing, D.T., V.K.T. and R.B.; Supervision,D.T., V.K.T. and R.B.

Nanocellulose/nanocarbon composites can be prepared withmany advantageous properties, such as high mechanical strength, flexibility, stretchability, tunablethermal and electrical conductivity, tunable optical transparency, photodynamic and photothermalactivity, nanoporous character and high adsorption capacity. They are therefore promising for awide range of industrial applications, such as energy generation, storage and conversion, waterpurification, food packaging, construction of fire retardants and shape memory devices. They alsohold great promise for biomedical applications, such as radical scavenging, photodynamic andphotothermal therapy of tumors and microbial infections, drug delivery, biosensorics, isolation ofvarious biomolecules, electrical stimulation of damaged tissues (e.g., cardiac, neural), neural andbone tissue engineering, engineering of blood vessels and advanced wound dressing, e.g., withantimicrobial and antitumor activity. However, the potential cytotoxicity and immunogenicity of thecomposites and their components must also be taken into account.Keywords: nanofibrillated cellulose; cellulose nanocrystals; fullerenes; graphene; carbon nanotubes;diamond nanoparticles; sensors; drug delivery; tissue engineering; wound dressing1. IntroductionNanocellulose/nanocarbon composites are hybrid materials containing cellulose and carbonnanoparticles. Integration of nanocarbon materials with nanocellulose provides functionality ofnanocarbons, using an eco-friendly, low-cost, strong, dimension-stable, nonmelting, nontoxic andnonmetal matrix or carrier, which alone has versatile applications in industry, biotechnology andbiomedicine (for a review, see [1,2]). In addition to its advantageous combination with nanocarbonmaterials, nanocellulose is an appealing material for biomedical applications due to its tunable chemicalNanomaterials 2020, 10, 196; doi:10.3390/nano10020196 www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials167Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 196properties, nonanimal origin, and resemblance to biological molecules in dimension, chemistry andviscoelastic properties, etc. [3–6].Cellulose nanomaterials include cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) and cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) [3].CNFs are manufactured using either a bottom-up or a top-down approach. The bottom-up approachinvolves bacterial (Gluconacetobacter) biosynthesis to obtain bacterial cellulose (BC), while, in thetop-down method, cellulosic biomass from plant fibers is disintegrated into smaller CNFs [7] thatcontain amorphous and crystalline regions [3]. The fibrillation of cellulose is achieved using mechanicalforces, chemical treatments, enzymes or combinations of these. After fibrillation, the width of CNFsis typically between 3 and 100 nm, and the length can be several micrometers [8]. Separation of thecrystalline parts from the amorphous regions of the fibers or fibrils to obtain CNCs typically requiresacid hydrolysis, which destroys the amorphous regions [9]. Entangled CNFs are longer, while CNCspossess shorter needle- or rod-like morphology with a similar diameter and a more rigid molecule dueto their higher crystallinity [3,9]. In general, the properties of nanocelluloses are variable and dependon their origin, type, processing, pretreatments and functionalization. Integration with other materials,as well as fabrication of the final product, further affects the properties of the resulting composite orhybrid structure.Carbon nanoparticles include fullerenes (usually C60), graphene-based particles (graphene,graphene oxide, reduced graphene oxide, graphene quantum dots), nanotubes (single-walled,double-walled, few-walled or multi-walled) and nanodiamonds (for a review, see [10–20]). The mostfrequently used nanocellulose/nanocarbon composites contain graphene or carbon nanotubes, whilecomposites of nanocellulose with nanodiamond, and particularly with fullerenes, are less frequentlyused. Other carbon nanostructures, which are less frequently used in nanocellulose/nanocarboncomposites, at least for biomedical applications, include carbon nanofibers [21–25], carbon quantumdots [26–28] activated carbon [29,30] and carbon black [31–33].Nanocellulose/nanocarbon composites can be prepared in one-dimensional (1D), two-dimensional(2D) or three-dimensional (3D) forms. 1D composites are represented, for example, by C60 fullerenesgrafted onto cellulose nanocrystals that have undergone amination or oxidation [34,35]. 2D compositesare represented by films, which can be self-standing or supported, i.e., in the form of free-standingmembranes [29,36–41] or in the form of coatings deposited on bulk materials [33,42]. The films can beformed by depositing carbon nanoparticles on a nanocellulose layer [43,44]. More frequently, however,they are fabricated from aqueous dispersions of nanocellulose and carbon nanoparticles [39,42].It should be pointed out that cellulose nanoparticles are excellent dispersive agents for carbonnanoparticles, as they prevent the aggregation of these nanoparticles and maintain them in long-termstable homogeneous suspensions without the need to subject them to chemical functionalization [45,46].Suspensions of cellulose and carbon nanoparticles are also starting materials for the creation of3D nanocellulose/nanocarbon composites in the form of aerogels, foams or sponges [45,47–50]. Inaddition, composite 3D scaffolds, especially for tissue engineering and for regenerative medicine,can be fabricated by 3D printing using bioinks based on cellulose and carbon nanoparticles [51,52].Both 2D composites and 3D composites can also be created by adding carbon nanoparticles tocultures of cellulose-producing bacteria, such as Gluconacetobacter xylinus. These nanoparticles are thenincorporated into bacterial nanocellulose in situ during its growth [53–57]. Another approach is viathe electrospinning or wet spinning of solutions containing cellulose and carbon nanoparticles [58–60].Nanocellulose/nanocarbon composites exhibit several more advantageous properties thanmaterials containing only cellulose nanoparticles or only carbon nanoparticles. Adding carbonnanoparticles to nanocellulose materials can further increase their mechanical strength [59,61].At the same time, the presence of nanocellulose promotes the flexibility and stretchability of thematerials [52,62,63]; for a review, see [64]. Adding graphene, carbon nanotubes or boron-dopeddiamond nanoparticles endows nanocellulose materials with electrical conductivity [39,50,57,65,66].Other advantageous properties of nanocellulose/nanocarbon composites include their thermalstability [67–69], tunable thermal conductivity and optical transparency [48,57,70], intrinsic fluorescence168Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 196and luminescence [26,71,72] photothermal activity [56], hydrolytic stability [61], nanoporous characterand high adsorption capacity [49,61]. Nanocellulose/nanocarbon composites can therefore be used in awide range of industrial and technological applications, such as water purification [22,29,43,49,54,56,61,73–76], the isolation and separation of various molecules [22,74,77–79], energy generation, storageand conversion [21,23,44,47,64,80–85], biocatalysis [86], food packaging [67–69,87], construction of fireretardants [48], heat spreaders [70] and shape memory devices [38,88–90]. These composites are alsoused as fillers for various materials, usually polymers, in order to improve their mechanical, electricaland other physical and chemical properties [67–69,87,91].In addition, nanocellulose/nanocarbon composites are promising for biomedical applications,though these applications are less frequent than industrial applications. Biomedical applicationsinclude radical scavenging [34,92], photothermal ablation of pathogenic bacteria [93], photodynamicand combined chemophotothermal therapy against cancer [35,94], drug delivery [16,28,65,72,95–97],biosensorics [31–33,63,66,71,91,98–104], and particularly tissue engineering and wound dressings.Hybrid materials containing nanocellulose and nanocarbons stimulated the growth and osteogenicdifferentiation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells [37,59]. They provided good substratesfor the attachment, growth and differentiation of SH-SHY5Y human neuroblastoma cells [51] and PC12neural cells, particularly under electrical stimulation [105]. They enhanced the outgrowth of neuritesfrom rat dorsal root ganglions in vitro and stimulated nerve regeneration in rats in vivo [106]. They alsopromoted the growth of vascular endothelial cells, enhanced angiogenesis and arteriogenesis in a chickchorioallantoic membrane model [107], and improved cardiac conduction when applied to surgicallydisrupted myocardium in dogs [52]. In addition, these materials supported the growth of humandermal fibroblasts [108] and mouse subcutaneous L929 fibroblasts [58,62], promoted wound healingin vivo in mice [109] and showed an antibacterial effect [30]. These materials are therefore promisingfor bone, neural and vascular tissue engineering, for creating cardiac patches and for advanced wounddressings.

Nanocellulose/Fullerene Composites2.1. Characterization of FullerenesFullerenes are spheroidal cage-like molecules composed entirely of carbon atoms (Figure 1a).Fullerenes with 60 and 70 carbon atoms (C60 and C70) are the most stable molecules, and they aretherefore most frequently used in industrial and biomedical applications. Fullerenes were discoveredin 1985 by Sir Harold Walter Kroto (1939–2016) and his co-workers Richard Smalley, Robert Curl, JamesHeath and Sean O’Brien. Kroto, Smalley and Curl were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1996. Fullereneswere named after Richard Buckminster “Bucky” Fuller (1895–1983), an American architect, designer,futurist, inventor, poet and visionary, who designed his geodesic dome on similar structural principles(for a review, see [12,13,18,119,120]). Fullerenes are carbon nanoparticles with diverse biologicalactivities. This is due to the fact that they can act as either acceptors or donors of electrons (for areview, see [121]). The acceptor activity can lead to oxidative damage to cell components, such asDNA, cell membrane, mitochondria and various enzymes, to the activation of inflammatory reactions,and to cell apoptosis. These harmful effects of fullerenes can, however, be utilized for photodynamictherapy against tumors and pathogenic microorganisms (for a review, see [122]). The electron donoractivity is associated with quenching oxygen radicals, which can be used in protecting skin against UVirradiation, in anti-inflammatory therapy against osteoarthritis, in cardioprotection during ischemia,in neuroprotection during amyloid-related diseases, damage by alcohol or heavy metals, in obesitytreatment and in the treatment of diabetes-related disorders. Due to their structural analogy withclathrin-coated vesicles, fullerenes are also promising candidates for drug and gene delivery (for areview, see [12,13,18,119]).Figure 1. Scheme of fullerene C60 (a) and of the preparation and structure of nanocellulose/fullerenecomposites (b).However, fullerenes have low solubility in many solvents, especially in water. This is a majordrawback for their wider application in biomedical applications. The water solubility of fullerenescan be achieved by functionalizing them with hydrophilic groups, but this approach does not solveproblems arising from the aggregation and clustering of fullerenes. In addition, the formation ofsinglet oxygen, which is needed for photodynamic therapy, decreases after functionalization due tothe perturbation of the fullerene π system. These problems can be mitigated by the complexation offullerenes with water-soluble agents, including nanocellulose [35].171Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 1962.2. Preparation and (Bio)Application of Nanocellulose/Fullerene CompositesCellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) were used to create nanocellulose/fullerene composites. Thesenanocrystals are typically produced by acid hydrolysis of cellulose fibers, employing either sulfuric acidor hydrochloric acid in order to destroy the amorphous regions of the cellulose, while the crystallinesegments remain intact. CNCs can have a needle-like or rod-like morphology, and are also referredto as nanowhiskers or nanorods. This morphology is characterized by a high aspect ratio (i.e., highlength to diameter ratio), and thus by a relatively large surface area. In addition, CNCs have a widerange of other advantageous properties, such as high mechanical resistance, broad chemical-modifyingcapacity, renewability, biodegradability and low cytotoxicity [34,35]; for a review, see [2]. From thesepoints of view, CNCs were considered ideal for immobilization of fullerene nanoparticles [92]. Ascheme of preparation of nanocellulose/fullerene composites is depicted in Figure 1b. Composites ofCNCs with fullerenes C60 were prepared by amine functionalization of CNCs and by subsequentlygrafting C60 onto the surface of amine-terminated CNCs [34]. Conversely, functionalized fullerenes,e.g., polyhydroxylated fullerenes C60(OH)30, were conjugated with the surface of CNCs [92]. Bothof these composites showed a higher radical scavenging capacity in vitro than fullerenes alone, andtherefore are promising for biomedical application in antioxidant therapies, e.g., as components ofskin care products. In the third type of composites, both cellulose nanocrystals and fullerenes werefunctionalized, i.e., amino-fullerene C60 derivatives were covalently grafted onto the surface of 2,2, 6, 6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxylradical (TEMPO)-oxidized nanocrystalline cellulose [35]. Thesecomposites hold promise for photodynamic cancer therapy (Table 1). When these composites wereadded to the culture medium of human breast cancer MCF-7 cells in the dark, they were taken upby these cells without changes in the cell viability, as revealed by a resazurin assay. However, whenirradiated with light, these composites showed dose-dependent toxicity for MCF-7 cells [35].However, fullerenes are less widely used in nanocellulose/nanocarbon composites than othercarbon allotropes, particularly graphene and carbon nanotubes. More frequently, fullerenes areincorporated into a non-nanostructured cellulose matrix. For example, fullerene C70, characterizedby a strong thermally activated delayed fluorescence at elevated temperatures, which is extremelyoxygen sensitive, was incorporated into ethyl cellulose, i.e., a highly oxygen-permeable polymer. Thiscomposite was used for construction of an optical dual sensor for oxygen and temperature [115]. Anoxygen sensor was constructed using isotopically enriched carbon-13 fullerene C70, dissolved in anethyl cellulose matrix [116]. Mixed-matrix membranes, consisting of ethyl cellulose as a continuousmatrix and fullerenes C60 as a dispersed phase, were prepared for propylene/propane separation [78].Electrospun cellulose acetate nanofibers reinforced with fullerenes were used in the construction ofdry-type actuators [123]. Cellulose impregnated with fullerenes C60 dissolved in o-xylene showedgreater extraction efficiency for Cu2+, Ni2+ and Cd2+ ions from an aqueous environment than thepure polymer [124]. Biocompatible composites containing polysaccharides (cellulose, chitosan andgamma-cyclodextrin) and fullerene derivatives (amino-C60 and hydroxy-C60) were developed forvarious applications ranging from dressing and treating chronically infected wounds to nonlinearoptics, biosensors, and therapeutic agents [118].3. Nanocellulose/Graphene Composites3.1. Characterization of GrapheneGraphene is a single layer of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms arranged into a two-dimensionalhoneycomb-like lattice (Figure 2a). In other words, graphene is a one-atom-thick layer of graphite.It is a basic building block for other carbon allotropes, such as fullerenes, carbon nanotubes andgraphite. Graphene is a very thin, nearly transparent sheet, but it is remarkably strong (about 100 timesstronger than steel), and highly electrically and thermally conductive (for a review, see [19,20,125,126]).Graphene can be prepared by various methods, which can be divided into two main categories, namelythe top-down approach and the bottom-up approach. The top-down approaches include treatment of172Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 196graphite by mechanical or electrochemical exfoliation, intercalation or sonication, and also nanotubeslicing. The bottom-up approaches include growth of graphene from carbon-metal melts, epitaxialgrowth of graphene on silicon carbide, the dry ice method, and deposition methods such as chemicalvapor deposition or dip coating a substrate with graphene oxide (GO), followed by GO reduction (fora review, see [19,20,125,126]). Graphene can be prepared in the form of monolayer or bilayer sheets,nanoplatelets, nanoflakes, nanoribbons and nanoscrolls. Chemically, graphene-based materials includepure graphene sheets, GO or reduced graphene oxide (rGO). Pure graphene sheets can be producedby mechanical exfoliation of graphite or by chemical vapor deposition. GO, a highly oxidative andwater-soluble form of graphene, can be obtained by the exfoliation of graphite oxide. Reduced GO canbe prepared by chemical, thermal or pressure reduction, and even by bacteria-mediated reductionof GO, which improves its electrical properties (for a review, see [13,18,19,37,125,126]). Grapheneand graphene-based materials hold a great promise not only for a wide range of industrial andtechnology applications, but also for biomedical applications, such as drug, gene and protein delivery,photothermal therapy, construction of biosensors, bioimaging, antimicrobial treatment, and also asscaffolds for tissue engineering (for a review, see [20]).Figure 2. Scheme of graphene (a) and of the preparation and structure of nanocellulose/graphenecomposites (b).3.2. Preparation and Industrial Application of Nanocellulose/Graphene CompositesSimilarly as in fullerenes, cellulose nanoparticles in the form of nanofibrils and nanocrystalsincrease the dispersion of graphene nanoparticles in water-based environments and prevent theiraggregation without the need to subject them to chemical functionalization [46]. A water-baseddispersion is the starting material for fabricating nanocellulose/graphene composites (Figure 2b). Thesecomposites can be created by filtration [127], filtration combined with hot pressing for fabricatingfilms [128], or by freeze-drying [75] and freeze-casting [48] for fabricating 3D materials, such as aerogelsand foams. Other methods are deposition of graphene on a nanocellulose layer [43] and incorporationof graphene into nanocellulose during its biological synthesis by bacteria [54–56].All forms of nanocellulose and graphene have been used for constructing nanocellulose/graphenecomposites, i.e., CNFs, CNCs, unmodified graphene, GO and rGO. In order to modulate the propertiesof nanocellulose/graphene composites for specific applications, these materials can be further enrichedby various substances, such as metallic or ceramic nanoparticles, oxides, carbides, sulfides, vitaminC, synthetic and natural polymers, enzymes and antibodies. For example, nanocellulose/graphenecomposites have high adsorption, filtration and photocatalytic ability, and they are therefore widelyused for water purification, e.g., for removing antibiotics [75], dyes [43], heavy metals, such as Cu2+,Hg2+, Ni2+ and Ag+ [61,76], or for their bactericidal effect [56]. The water-cleaning capacity of thesecomposites can be further enhanced by introducing additional photocatalytic agents, i.e., palladium173Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 196nanoparticles [54] or zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles [73]. An optimized ultrafiltration membranefor water purification was constructed from polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), modified by cellulosenanocrystals functionalized with common bactericides, such as dodecyl dimethyl benzyl ammoniumchloride, ZnO and GO nanosheets [129]. Another important additive is vitamin C, which reducesthe GO in nanocellulose/GO composites, increases the surface area of the material and increases poreformation, and thus enhances the capacity of the composites for water purification [49]. A combinationof rGO-coated cellulose nanofibers with hydrophobic and oleophilic trimethyl chlorosilane enhancedthe adsorption capacity of this composite, which is necessary for effective removal of oil-basedpollutants from water [74].Another important industrial application of nanocellulose/graphene composites is in energystorage, generation and conversion. Devices for these purposes include supercapacitors [64,80,130], hydrogen storage devices [131], electrodes for hydrogen evolution reaction [132], lithium ionbatteries [133], actuators [81], solar steam generators [82] and electric heating membranes [83].These devices can be based on pure nanocellulose/nanocarbon composites without additives [80–83]. However, they often contain additives such as manganese oxide (MnO), which contributes tofaradaic pseudocapacitance in supercapacitors [130] or polypyrrole, which acts as an insulator, but itsoxidized derivatives are good electrical conductors [134]. Other additives are palladium or platinumnanoparticles for enhanced hydrogen storage [131], nitrogen-doped molybdenum carbide nanobelts inelectrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction [132], and silicon oxide nanoparticles in lithium ionbatteries [133].Other important industrial applications of nanocellulose/graphene composites are in theconstruction of fire retardants, shape memory devices, biocatalysts and materials for food packaging.Super-insulating, fire-retardant, mechanically strong anisotropic foams were produced by freeze-castingsuspensions of cellulose nanofibers, GO and sepiolite nanorods, and they performed better thantraditional polymer-based insulating materials [48]. Shape memory devices are based on GO/CNC thinfilms and nanomembranes [38,88] or on GO introduced into a nanocellulose paper made of nanofibersextracted from sisal fibers [89]. An example of a biocatalyst is a nanocellulose/polypyrrole/GOnanocomposite for immobilization of lipase, a versatile hydrolytic enzyme. This biocatalyst wasemployed for synthesizing ethyl acetoacetate, a fruit flavor compound [86]. Food packaging materialswere constructed by filling CNCs and rGO, either separately or in the form of CNC/rGO nanohybrids,into poly (lactic acid) (PLA) matrix or in a poly (3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV)matrix. These composite materials exhibited better mechanical properties than the pristine polymers,and possessed antibacterial activity. In addition, the composites with CNC/rGO nanohybrids performedbetter than those with a single component nanofiller, i.e., either CNCs or rGO. Due to their antibacterialactivity, antioxidant properties and good in vitro cytocompatibility, these composites are also promisingfor biomedical applications, e.g., as scaffolds for tissue engineering [67–69,87].3.3. Biomedical Application of Nanocellulose/Graphene CompositesThe biomedical applications of nanocellulose/nanographene composites include photothermalablation of pathogenic bacteria, combined chemo-photothermal therapy against cancer, drug delivery,biosensorics, isolation and separation of various biomolecules, wound dressing and particularly tissueengineering (Table 1).For photothermal ablation of pathogenic bacteria, a composite paper containing nanocellulosewith Au linked to GO using quaternized carboxymethyl chitosan was developed. When excitedby near-infrared laser irradiation, the paper generated a rise in temperature of more than 80 ◦C,sufficient for photothermal ablation, both on Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcusaureus) and on Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Additionally, thecomposite paper showed a remarkable enhancement in tensile strength, bursting index and tear indexin comparison with the properties of pure nanocellulose paper [93].174Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 196For chemophotothermal synergistic therapy of colon cancer cells, dual stimuli-responsivepolyelectrolyte nanoparticles were developed by layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly of aminatednanodextran and carboxylated nanocellulose on the surface of chemically modified GO. Tests on theHCT116 human colon cancer cell line revealed that these nanoparticles allowed for the intracellulardelivery of curcumin, which was released in response either to acidic environments or to near-infraredexcitation [94]. In this context, nanocellulose/graphene composites are good candidates as carriers forcontrolled drug delivery, particularly of anticancer drugs. Systems releasing doxorubicin, a model drugwith broad-spectrum anticancer properties, were developed. These systems included nanocompositecarboxymethyl cellulose/GO hydrogel beads [95], nanocomposite films made of graphene quantumdots incorporated into a carboxymethyl cellulose hydrogel [72] or macroporous polyacrylamidehydrogels. These hydrogels were prepared using an oil-in-water Pickering emulsion, containing GOand hydroxyethyl cellulose with a quaternary ammonium group [96].Sensing and biosensing is another important application of nanocellulose/graphene composites.These sensors can be divided into electrochemical, piezoelectric, optical and acoustic wave-basedsensors. Electrochemical sensors were constructed for detecting cholesterol [98], glucose and pathogenicbacteria [110], avian leucosis virus [111] and organic liquids [112]. The biosensor for detecting cholesterolwas based on chemically-modified nanocellulose, grafted with silylated GO and enriched with ZnOnanoparticles in order to enhance its electrical conductivity [98]. The biosensor for detecting glucoseand pathogenic bacteria was based on nanocellulose paper coated with GO, reduced by vitamin C andfunctionalized with platinum nanoparticles with a cauliflower-like morphology in order to enhancethe electrical conductivity of the composite. The platinum surface was functionalized either withglucose oxidase (via chitosan encapsulation) or with an RNA aptamer [110]. The biosensor for theavian leucosis virus was an immunosensor, based on graphene-perylene-3, 4, 9, 10-tetracarboxylic acidnanocomposites as carriers for primary antibodies, on composites of nanocellulose and Au nanoparticlesas carriers for secondary antibodies, and on the alkaline phosphatase catalytic reaction [111]. The sensorfor organic liquids, mainly organic solvents, was based on cellulose nanocrystal-graphene nanohybrids,selectively located in the interstitial space between the natural rubber latex microspheres [112].Piezoelectric nanocellulose/graphene-based sensors have usually been designed for strain sensing,i.e., as wearable electronics for monitoring the motion of various parts of the human body, e.g.,fingers [63,99,113]. For these purposes, the flexibility and stretchability of nanocellulose was furtherenhanced by adding other polymers, such as elastomers, represented e.g., by polydimethylsiloxane(PDMS) [113], or hydrogels, represented e.g., by poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), crosslinked (together withcellulose nanofibers and graphene) with borax [63].Optical sensors can be based on surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) orfluorescence. Cellulose SERS strips decorated with plasmonic nanoparticles, termedgraphene-isolated-Au-nanocrystals (GIANs), were developed for constructing portable sensors fordetecting complex biological samples, e.g., for detecting free bilirubin in the blood of newborns [100].A fluorescence sensor, based on sulfur and nitrogen-co-doped graphene quantum dots, immersedinto nanocellulosic hydrogels, was developed for detecting laccase. This enzyme is widely used inindustrial and technological applications, such as bleaching of fabrics, tooth whitening, decoloration ofhair, water purification and in oxidizing dyes in beer, must and wines [71].An example of an acoustic wave-based sensor is an ammonia sensor, based on a quartz crystalmicrobalance (QCM) with a sensing coating. This coating is composed of negatively-chargedelectrospun cellulose acetate nanofibers, positively-charged polyethylenimine and negatively-chargedGO, and it was created by the electrostatic LbL self-assembly technique [101].For protein isolation, a metal affinity carboxymethyl cellulose-functionalized magneticgraphene was prepared by successive modifications of GO nanosheets with magnetic nanoparticles,carboxymethyl cellulose and iminodiacetic acid, and then chelated with copper ions. This compositeexhibited high adsorption selectivity toward histidine-rich proteins, which was utilized for isolatinghemoglobin from human whole blood, and also for isolating a polyhistidine-tagged recombinant175Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 196protein from Escherichia coli lysate, namely Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin B [77]. For macromolecularseparation, cellulose acetate nanocomposite ultrafiltration membranes were fabricated using 2D layerednanosheets, e.g., GO and exfoliated molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), and were successfully tested usingmacromolecular bovine serum albumin [79].Nanocellulose/graphene composites are also important components of tissue engineering scaffolds,improving their mechanical properties and their bioactivity. In the studies by Pal et al. (2017), mentionedabove, a PLA/CNC/rGO nanocomposite film showed antibacterial activity against Gram-positiveStaphylococcus aureus and against Gram-negative Escherichia coli. At the same time, this film exhibitednegligible cytotoxicity against a mouse NIH-3T3 fibroblast cell line, as revealed by an MTT assayof the activity of mitochondrial oxidoreductase enzymes [87]. Nanocomposites of CNCs and rGO,incorporated into PLA matrix through the melt-mixing method, were noncytotoxic and cytocompatiblewith epithelial human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells [68]. PLA incorporated with rGO andTEMPO-oxidized CNCs, grafted with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), displayed radical scavenging activityand negligible toxicity and cytocompatibility to mouse embryonic C3H10T1/2 cells [69]. A compositefilm consisting of hydrophilic bacterial cellulose nanofibers and hydrophobic rGO, prepared from GOusing a bacterial reduction method, supported the adhesion, viability and proliferation of human bonemarrow mesenchymal stem cells in a similar way to standard cell culture polystyrene, and better thanpure rGO films [37]. Incorporating GO into electrospun cellulose acetate nanofibrous scaffolds enhancedthe adhesion and growth of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells. It also enhanced osteogenicdifferentiation of these cells, manifested by the activity of alkaline phosphatase, and biomineralizationof the scaffolds in a simulated body fluid [59]. Nanofibrous composites of bacterial nanocellulose,a conductive poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) (PEDOT) polymer and GO, mimicking the nativeextracellular matrix and allowing electrical stimulation of neural PC12 cells, induced specific orientationand differentiation of these cells [105]. Polyvinyl alcohol/carboxymethyl cellulose (PVA/CMC) scaffoldsloaded with rGO nanoparticles, prepared by lyophilization, enhanced the proliferation of EA.hy926endothelial cells in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo using a chick chorioallantoic membrane model [107].Polyacrylamide-sodium carboxymethylcellulose hybrid hydrogels reinforced with GO and/or CNCsalso have potential for tissue engineering applications due to their tunable mechanical properties [135].Genetically modified hydrophobin, a fungal cysteine-rich protein, was used to connect nanofibrillatedcellulose of wood origin and graphene flakes in order to construct biomimetic mechanically-resistantmaterials similar to nacre and combining high toughness, strength and stiffness [136].Nanocellulose/graphene composites also have great potential for the fabrication of antibacterialtextiles and for advanced wound dressing. Antibacterial textiles were prepared by electrospinning amixture containing cellulose acetate, TiO2 and GO sheets. These textiles showed high antibacterialactivity with an inhibition rate higher than 95% against Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus [137]. Bacterialcellulose is considered as one of the most suitable materials for advanced wound dressing, due to itsappropriate mechanical properties, such as strength, Young’s modulus, elasticity and conformability,and also due to its great capacity to retain moisture in the wound (for a review, see [2]). These favorableproperties can be further enhanced by adding graphene-based materials and by crosslinking withsynthetic polymers, such as poly (ethylene glycol), poly (vinyl alcohol), poly (acrylic acid) and poly(acrylamide). In a study by Chen et al. (2019), a bacterial nanocellulose-grafted poly (acrylic acid)/GOcomposite hydrogel was prepared as a potential wound dressing. The inclusion of GO improvedthe attachment and proliferation of human dermal fibroblasts in cultures on the composites [108].Similarly, hydroxypropyl cellulose matrix incorporated with GO and silver-coated ZnO nanoparticlesshowed improved tensile strength, and also anti-ultraviolet, antibacterial and immunostimulatoryeffects, which promoted wound healing in an in vivo mouse model [109].176Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 1964. Nanocellulose/Carbon Nanotube Composites4.1. Characterization of Carbon NanotubesCarbon nanotubes (CNTs; Figure 3a) are tubular structures formed by a single cylindrical graphenesheet (single-walled carbon nanotubes, referred to as SWCNTs or SWNTs) or several graphene sheetsarranged concentrically (multiwalled carbon nanotubes, referred to as MWCNTs or MWNTs, whichalso include double-walled CNTs (DWCNTs [16]), and few-walled CNTs (FWCNTs [17]). Carbonnanotubes were discovered as a by-product of fullerene synthesis, and were first described by Iijima etal. (1991) [138]. CNTs have a high aspect ratio (i.e., length to diameter ratio) and thus a relatively largesurface area. Their diameter is on the nanometer scale (e.g., from 0.4 nm to 2–3 nm in single-wallednanotubes), but their length can reach several micrometers or even centimeters. Due to these properties,CNTs are suitable candidates for hydrogen storage, for the removal of contaminants from water andair, and also for drug delivery. CNTs have excellent mechanical properties, mainly due to the sp2bonds. The tensile strength of SWCNTs has been reported to be almost 100 times higher than that ofsteel, while their specific weight is about six times lower. CNTs can therefore be used for reinforcingvarious synthetic and natural polymers for industrial and biomedical applications, e.g., for hard tissueengineering. When added to a polymer matrix, CNTs can resemble inorganic mineral nanoparticlesin the bone tissue, and they can form nanoscale irregularities on the surface of 2D materials andin the pores of 3D materials, which improve the cell adhesion and growth. CNTs are electricallyconductive and enable electrical stimulation of cells, which further improves the adhesion, growth anddifferentiation of cells (for a review, see [10–14,18,139]). However, free CNTs can be cytotoxic, which isattributed to their ability to cause oxidative damage, and also to their contamination with transitionmetals (e.g., Fe, Ni, Y), which serve as catalysts during CNT preparation. Methods for producingmetal-free CNTs have therefore been developed, e.g., arc-discharge evaporation of graphite rods [139].Figure 3. Scheme of multi-walled and single-walled carbon nanotubes (a) and of the preparation andstructure of nanocellulose/carbon nanotube composites (b).CNTs also resemble CNFs from the point of view of their morphology and their mechanicalproperties. For example, highly crystalline, thick CNFs derived from tunicates exhibited mean strengthof 3–6 GPa, which was comparable with commercially available MWCNTs. However, the mean strengthof other types of CNFs is lower; for example, in wood-derived CNFs the mean strength ranged from1.6 to 3 GPa [140]. CNTs therefore improve the mechanical strength of nanocellulose/CNT composites,and endow them with electrical conductivity, similarly as graphene. As a result, nanocellulose/CNTcomposites are used in similar industrial and biomedical applications as nanocellulose/graphenecomposites, e.g., water purification, energy generation, storage and conversion, filling polymericmaterials, constructing sensors and biosensors, drug delivery, cancer treatment, electrical stimulationof tissues, and tissue engineering.177Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 1964.2. Preparation and Industrial Application of Nanocellulose/CNT CompositesThe nanocellulose component in the nanocellulose/CNT composites is used in the form ofnanofibrils and nanocrystals, and carbon nanotubes usually in the form of SWCNTs or MWCNTs.Similarly as in composites containing graphene and other carbon allotropes, cellulose nanoparticlesfacilitate the homogeneous dispersion of CNTs in aqueous environments (Figure 3b), where the twotypes of nanoparticles are linked by noncovalent interactions, e.g., hydrophobic and electrostaticinteractions [42,46]. The dispersion of CNTs can be further facilitated by TEMPO-mediated oxidation ofcellulose nanoparticles, which endows them with abundant anionic carboxyl groups [141]. Other waysinclude the functionalization of CNTs with self-assembling amphiphilic glycosylated proteins [142]or the use of oil-in-water Pickering emulsions of cellulose nanoparticles [143]. From the aqueousdispersions, 2D and 3D nanocellulose/CNT composites can be formed, e.g., by vacuum filtration,centrifugal cast molding, foam forming, casting and printing [39,45,50,141]. Pickering emulsionsof cellulose nanocrystals and SWCNTs or MWCNTs were used for fabricating aerogels and foamsby freeze-drying [143]. Similarly as in nanocellulose/graphene composites, CNTs can be added tocultures of bacteria producing nanocellulose, and incorporated into the bacterial nanocellulose duringits growth [53,57]. Composite nanocellulose/SWCNT films can be transparent or semitransparent [39,45,141], and can transmit radiant energy [144].Like nanocellulose/graphene composites, nanocellulose/CNT composites can be combined withvarious atoms, molecules and nanoparticles in order to enhance their properties for specific applications.For example, Ag nanoparticles attached to the surface of MWCNTs influenced the electrochemicalproperties of CNT-based films developed on a bacterial nanocellulose membrane [36]. Nanocelluloseand CNTs can be also used as additives to various hybrid materials. For example, a hybrid material,created by combination of poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly (styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS),silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), CNTs and a nanocellulose layer, was used for constructing a tactilesensor [103]. Incorporation of polypyrrole-coated CNTs into chemically cross-linked CNC aerogelscreated promising materials for flexible 3D supercapacitors [145]. A combination of cellulose acetate,chitosan and SWCNTs with Fe3O4 and TiO2 in electrospun nanofibers enables combined removal ofCr6+, As5+, methylene blue and Congo red from aqueous solutions via the adsorption and photocatalyticreduction processes [146].Energy-related applications of nanocellulose/CNT composites include biofuel cells, varactors,supercapacitors, and electrodes for lithium batteries, thermoelectric generators for heat-to-electricityconversion or for constructing heating elements [50]. A biofuel cell comprising electrodes based onsupercapacitive materials, i.e., on CNTs and a nanocellulose/polypyrrole composite, was utilizedto power an oxygen biosensor. Laccase, immobilized on naphthylated MWCNTs, and fructosedehydrogenase, adsorbed on a porous polypyrrole matrix, were used as cathode and anodebioelectrocatalysts, respectively [84]. Another biofuel cell was based on a conductive MWCNTnetwork, developed on a bacterial nanocellulose film, and functionalized with redox enzymes,including pyroquinoline quinone glucose dehydrogenase (anodic catalyst) and bilirubin oxidase(cathodic catalyst). This system generated electrical power via the oxidation of glucose and thereduction of molecular oxygen [44]. Microelectromechanical system varactors, i.e., voltage-controlledcapacitors, consisted of a freestanding SWCNT film, which was employed as a movable component,and a flexible nanocellulose aerogel filling [85]. Supercapacitors with high physical flexibility,desirable electrochemical properties and excellent mechanical integrity were realized by rationallyexploiting the unique properties of bacterial nanocellulose, CNTs, and ionic liquid-based polymergel electrolytes [147]. Other flexible 3D supercapacitor devices were fabricated by incorporatingpolypyrrole nanofibers, polypyrrole-coated CNTs, and manganese dioxide (MnO2) nanoparticlesin chemically cross-linked cellulose nanocrystal aerogels [145]. Electrospun core-shell nanofibrousmembranes, containing CNTs stabilized with cellulose nanocrystals, were developed for use ashigh-performance flexible supercapacitor electrodes with enhanced water resistance, thermal stabilityand mechanical toughness [40]. Electrodes for lithium batteries were based on freestanding178Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 196LiCoO2/MWCNT/cellulose nanofibril composites, fabricated by a vacuum filtration technique [148],or on freestanding CNT-nanocrystalline cellulose composite films [41]. Thermoelectric generatorsfor heat-to-electricity conversion were based on large-area bacterial nanocellulose films with anembedded/dispersed CNT percolation network, incorporated into the films during nanocelluloseproduction by bacteria in culture [57]. Electrical energy can also be converted into thermal energy,as demonstrated by the composite structure of wood-derived nanocellulose, MWCNTs and pulp,designed for a heating element application [50].4.3. Biomedical Application of Nanocellulose/CNT CompositesBiomedical applications of composites of cellulose and CNTs are summarized in Table 1. Thesecomposites are important systems for drug delivery. The CNTs in the composites can be conjugated withmany therapeutics, usually anticancer drugs, but also other types of drugs. For example, an osmoticpump tablet system coated with cellulose acetate membrane containing MWCNTs was developed fordelivery of indomethacin (for a review, see [16,65]). Cancer cells can be killed by nanocellulose-CNTdispersions even without the presence of anticancer drugs. For example, nonmercerized type-IIcellulose nanocrystals in dispersions with SWCNTs displayed cytotoxicity for human epithelialcolorectal adenocarcinoma Caco-2 cells, but they enhanced the mitochondrial metabolism of normalcells [149].Construction of sensors and biosensors is another important application of nanocellulose/CNTcomposites useful for (bio) technology and medicine. A tactile piezoresistance and thermoelectric-basedsensor, mentioned above, which is capable of simultaneously sensing temperature and pressure, isfabricated from TEMPO-oxidized cellulose, PEDOT:PSS, AgNPs and CNTs [103]. Another pressuresensor was developed using aerogels consisting of plant cellulose nanofibers and functionalizedfew-walled CNTs [17]. Highly conductive and flexible membranes with a semi-interpenetratingnetwork structure, fabricated from MWCNTs and cellulose nanofibers, showed the electrical featuresof capacitive pressure sensors and were promising for various electronics applications, e.g., touchscreens [150]. Advanced flexible strain sensors for controlling the human body motion were fabricatedby pumping hybrid fillers consisting of CNTs/CNCs into porous electrospun thermoplastic polyurethanemembranes [91]. Other strain sensors were fabricated by a facile latex assembly approach, in whichCNCs played a key role in tailoring the percolating network of conductive natural rubber/CNTcomposites [114]. A water-responsive shape memory hybrid polymer, based on a thermoplasticpolyurethane matrix crosslinked with hydroxyethyl cotton cellulose nanofibers and MWCNTs, was alsodeveloped for constructing a strain sensor [90]. A flexible and highly sensitive humidity sensor, capableof monitoring human breath, was based on TEMPO-oxidized nanofibrillated cellulose and CNTs [104].An electrochemical biosensor for three adenosine triphosphate (ATP) metabolites, namely uric acid,xanthine and hypoxanthine, was based on a composite of NH2-MWCNT/black phosphorene/AgNPs,dispersed in carboxymethyl cellulose [102]. Another electrochemical molecularly-imprinted sensor wasbased on a nanofibrous membrane prepared by the electrospinning technique from cellulose acetate,MWCNTs and polyvinylpyrrolidone, and was used for determining ascorbic acid [151]. An oxygenbiosensor powered by a biofuel cell containing MWNCTs, a nanocellulose/polypyrrole composite,laccase and fructose dehydrogenase, was mentioned above [84]. Versatile wearable textile sensors, e.g.,for gas sensing, were produced from cellulose nanofibers extracted from tunicates, homogeneouslycomposited with SWCNTs, by wet spinning in an aligned direction [60].Other important biomedical applications of nanocellulose/CNT composites are in electricalstimulation of cells and tissues in order to improve their regeneration and function, and in tissueengineering. For example, stretchable, flexible and electrically conductive biopatches for restoratingconduction in damaged cardiac regions and for preventing arrhythmias were prepared. Thesepatches were based on nanofibrillated cellulose/SWCNT ink three-dimensionally printed onto bacterialnanocellulose. They restored cardiac conduction after its disruption by a surgical incision made inthe ventricular part of the heart in experimental dogs [52]. For neural tissue stimulation, multiblock179Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 196conductive nerve scaffolds with self-powered electrical stimulation were prepared. These scaffoldswere based on polypyrrole/bacterial nanocellulose composites with platinum nanoparticles on theanode side for glucose oxidation, and nitrogen-doped CNTs on the cathode side for oxygen reduction.These scaffolds enhanced the elongation of neurites outgrowing from rat dorsal root ganglions in vitroand stimulated nerve regeneration in a rat sciatic nerve gap model in vivo in comparison withcomposites containing only polypyrrole and bacterial nanocellulose. These scaffolds could replacethe metal needles that are currently used for external electrical stimulation of neural tissue, whichmay cause pain and a risk of infection [106]. 3D printing was also used for creating scaffolds basedon a conductive ink composed of wood-derived CNFs and SWCNTs. These scaffolds were intendedfor neural tissue engineering for experimental brain studies, and supported the attachment, growthand viability of human neuroblastoma SH-SHY5Y cells [51]. Other scaffolds for tissue engineeringconsisted of electrospun cellulose acetate nanofibers, assembled with positively-charged chitosanand negatively-charged MWCNTs via an LbL technique. These scaffolds promoted the adsorptionof cell adhesion-mediating molecules from the serum supplement of the culture medium and theadhesion and growth of mouse subcutaneous L929 fibroblasts [117]. Our own results related to thepotential application of nanocellulose/CNT composites as scaffolds for tissue engineering are reportedin Appendix A.5. Nanocellulose/Nanodiamond Composites5.1. Characterization of NanodiamondDiamond is an allotrope of carbon, consisting of carbon atoms arranged in a cubic crystal structurecovalently bonded in sp3 hybridization (Figure 4a). Like all nanostructured materials, nanodiamondsor diamond nanoparticles are defined as features not exceeding 100 nm in at least one dimension,although some larger diamond particles, i.e., 125–210 nm, are still referred to as nanodiamonds (fora review, see [152]). At the same time, the size of ultrananocrystalline diamond particles is 3–5nm [153,154]. Diamond nanoparticles can be prepared by various methods. The most widely usedtechniques are detonation of carbon-containing explosives in an oxygen-deficit environment andmicrowave-enhanced plasma chemical vapor deposition (MECVD). Other techniques include theradiofrequency plasma-assisted chemical vapor deposition (PACVD) method, milling of diamondmicrocrystals, hydrothermal synthesis, ion bombardment, laser bombardment, ultrasound synthesisand electrochemical synthesis (for a review, see [10,152–156]). Nanodiamonds are considered to bethe most advanced carbon materials in the world. This is due to their excellent mechanical, optical,electrical, thermal and chemical properties. The mechanical properties of nanodiamonds includethe highest hardness of all materials on earth, a high Young’s modulus, high fracture toughness,high pressure resistance and a low friction coefficient. Their optical properties include transparency,high optical dispersion, and their ability to display various colors and to emit intrinsic luminescence(fluorescence), which is due to defects in the diamond lattice or contamination of the lattice withforeign atoms, such as N, B, H, Ni, Co, Cr or Si. Regarding their electrical properties, nanodiamondscan act as good insulators in their pristine state and as semiconductors after doping, usually withboron. Their thermal properties include superior thermal conductivity and low thermal expansion.The chemical properties of nanodiamonds include low chemical reactivity and resistance to liquid- andgas-phase oxidations. However, nanodiamonds can be doped with various atoms, and their surfacecan be functionalized by various atoms, chemical groups and (bio)molecules ([152,153,157,158]; for areview, see [10–15,155]).180Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 196Figure 4. Scheme of a nanodiamond (a) and of the preparation and structure ofnanocellulose/nanodiamond composites (b).5.2. Preparation and (Bio)Application of Nanocellulose/Nanodiamond CompositesThere is greater use of diamond nanoparticles than of fullerenes in nanocellulose/nanocarboncomposites, but diamond nanoparticles are used less than graphene and carbon nanotubes. This maybe because a nanodiamond is more expensive and is electrically nonconductive in its pristine state. Incomposites with nanofibrillated cellulose (Figure 4b), a nanodiamond was used for constructing highlythermally conductive, mechanically resistant and optically transparent films with potential applicationas lateral heat spreaders for portable electronic equipment [70]. A highly mechanically resistant andoptically transparent nanopaper was made of cationic CNFs and anionic nanodiamond particles byfiltration from a hydrocolloid and subsequent drying [159]. Moreover, a diamond can be renderedelectrically semiconductive by doping it with boron, and then can be used for constructing biosensors.For example, a sensor for biotin was developed by the adsorption of captavidin, a nitrated avidin withmoderate affinity to biotin, on a carboxymethylcellulose layer stabilized on a boron-doped diamondelectrode by a Nafion film. This biosensor was used for analyzing biotin in blood plasma [66] (Table 1).The reinforcing effect of diamond nanoparticles, coupled with their optical transparency,has also been used advantageously for other biomedical applications, particularly for wounddressing. Nanocellulose/nanodiamond composites are more mechanically resistant than purelynanocellulose-based materials, but they retain their flexibility and stretchability. In addition, theiroptical transparency enables direct inspection of wounds without the need to remove the dressing. Forexample, incorporating diamond nanoparticles in a concentration of 2 wt % into chitosan/bacterialnanocellulose composite films resulted in a 3.5-fold increase in the elastic modulus of these films. Thesecomposite films were transparent, but their transparency can be modulated by the concentration ofdiamond nanoparticles, turning them gray and semitransparent at higher nanodiamond concentrations(3 and 4 wt %). The viability of mouse subcutaneous L929 fibroblasts in cultures on these films,evaluated by an MTT test of the activity of cell mitochondrial enzymes, was more than 90% at 24 h afterseeding. However, at 48 h, it had dropped to about 75%, which indicated that diamond nanoparticlesare slightly cytotoxic [62]. A similar result was obtained on L929 fibroblasts grown on electrospuncomposite nanofibrous mats containing chitosan, bacterial cellulose and 1–3 wt % medical-gradenanodiamonds [58]. The viability of these cells, estimated by the MTT assay, dropped from approx.90% on day 1 to approx. 75% on day 3. Nevertheless, the addition of nanodiamonds facilitated theelectrospinning process, reduced the diameter of the nanofibers in the mats, regulated the water vaporpermeability of the mats, enhanced their hydrophilicity and improved their mechanical properties to asimilar level as in native skin [58].Adding diamond nanoparticles per se did not significantly increase the antibacterial activityof chitosan/bacterial nanocellulose composites [62]. This activity can be further enhanced, e.g., by181Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 196adding silver nanoparticles [160]. Nanocellulose/nanodiamond composites can also act as a suitableplatform for drug delivery. This was demonstrated on transparent doxorubicin-loaded carboxylatednanodiamonds/cellulose nanocomposite membranes, which are promising candidates for wounddressings. These membranes are porous, transparent, with appropriate mechanical properties, andwithout doxorubicin they are noncytotoxic for HeLa cells [97].6. Composites of Nanocellulose with Other Carbon NanoparticlesIn addition to fullerenes, graphene, nanotubes and nanodiamonds, other important carbonnanoparticles used in industrial, biotechnological and biomedical applications include carbonnanofibers, carbon quantum dots and nanostructures formed by activated carbon and carbon black. Allthese nanomaterials can be used in nanocellulose/nanocarbon composites. The biomedical applicationsof these composites are summarized in Table 1.6.1. Composites of Nanocellulose and Carbon NanofibersCarbon nanofibers can be created by carbonization of cellulose nanofibers originating frombacterial nanocellulose [21,23,161], urea [161], filter paper [162] or plant-derived cellulose [22,24].Another method of preparing carbon nanofibers is chemical vapor deposition (CVD; [25]). Thesecarbon nanofibers can be further combined with other carbon nanoparticles, mainly graphene. Forexample, a composite paper consisting of nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers, reduced graphene oxide(rGO) and bacterial cellulose was designed as a high-performance, mechanically tough, and bendableelectrode for a supercapacitor. The bacterial nanocellulose in this paper is exploited both as a biomassprecursor for the creation of carbon nanofibers by pyrolysis and as a supporting substrate for thenewly-created material [21]. In another study, highly conductive freestanding cross-linked carbonnanofibers, derived from bacterial cellulose in a rapid plasma pyrolysis process, were used as substratesfor the growth of vertically-oriented graphene sheets for constructing alternating current filteringsupercapacitors [23]. A small amount of rGO can also act as an effective initiator of carbonizationof cellulose nanofibers through microwave treatment [24]. Carbonization of aerogels, preparedfrom a mixture of PVA, cellulose nanofibers and GO by freeze-drying, enhanced the hydrophobicproperties, the specific surface area and the adsorption capacity of these aerogels. These materials thenbecame suitable candidates for oil-water separation and environmental protection [22]. In additionto graphene, cellulose-derived carbon nanofibers can be combined with various other nanoparticlesand nanostructures, such as Pt nanoparticles for methanol oxidation reaction [161], TiO2 films andFe3O4 nanoparticles for lithium ion batteries [162], tin oxide (SnO) nanoparticles for lithium-sulfurbatteries [163] or NiCo2S4 nanoparticles for hydrogen evolution reaction [164]. Carbon nanofibersare also promising for biomedical applications, particularly bone tissue engineering. Their nanoscalediameter produced a nanoscale surface roughness of their compacts or of their composite withpoly-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA). This nanoroughness promoted preferential adhesion of osteoblastsfrom other cell types, particularly fibroblasts, which could prevent fibrous encapsulation of boneimplants [25].6.2. Composites of Nanocellulose and Carbon Quantum DotsCarbon quantum dots (CQDs) are quasispherical carbon nanoparticles (less than 10 nm indiameter) with a chemical structure and physical properties similar to those of graphene oxide. Thesenanoparticles emit a strong wavelength-dependent fluorescence. By changing the CQD size, the colorof the emitted light can be tuned from deep ultraviolet to visible and near-infrared light. In addition, thefluorescence of CQDs, and also their water solubility, can be further modulated by functionalizing theirsurface with various atoms, chemical functional groups and molecules, such as metals, carboxyl groups,organic dyes and polymers. CQDs present good photostability, low photobleaching and relativelylow cytotoxicity, and they are therefore considered to be suitable for biomedical applications such asbioimaging, biosensing, photodynamic and photothermal therapy of cancer, and drug delivery [165].182Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 196In hybrid materials with nanocellulose, CQDs were applied for constructing biosensors anddrug delivery systems, and also for water purification. An optical sensor for visual discriminationof biothiols was based on a bacterial cellulose nanopaper substrate with ratiometric fluorescentsensing elements. These elements included N-acetyl l-cysteine capped green cadmium telluride (CdTe)quantum dots-rhodamine B and red CdTe quantum dots-carbon dots [26]. Hybrid materials containingcarbon quantum dots and cellulose are also promising carriers for drug delivery. Composite core/shellchitosan-poly (ethylene oxide)-carbon quantum dots/carboxymethyl cellulose-poly(vinyl alcohol)nanofibers were prepared through coaxial electrospinning as a biodegradable implant for local deliveryof temozolomide (TMZ), an anticancer drug. When tested in vitro, the antitumor activity of TMZconjugated with carbon quantum dots against the tumor U251 cell lines was higher than the activity ofthe free drug [28]. Last but not least, carbon quantum dots, homogeneously dispersed together withmagnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles in electrospun cellulose nanofibers, were promising for the removal ofHg(II) ions from water [27].6.3. Composites of Nanocellulose and Activated CarbonActivated carbon is a form of carbon processed to have small, low-volume pores that increase thesurface area, which is then available for the adsorption and removal of various toxic contaminantsand microorganisms. Composite membranes consisting of a bilayer of porous activated carbonand TEMPO-oxidized plant-derived CNFs showed high capability for removing Escherichia colifrom water [29]. Activated carbon was also a component of a wound dressing material consistingof a polyvinyl alcohol and cellulose acetate phthalate polymeric composite film, reinforced withCu/Zn bimetal-dispersed activated carbon micro/nanofibers. This material suppressed the growth ofPseudomonas aeruginosa, the most prevalent bacteria in infected wounds caused by burns, surgery andtraumatic injuries [30].6.4. Composites of Nanocellulose and Carbon BlackCarbon black is a form of paracrystalline carbon, produced industrially by partial combustion orthermal decomposition of gaseous or liquid hydrocarbons under controlled conditions. Carbon blackhas a high surface-area-to-volume ratio, though not so high as that of activated carbon. Although itis considered to have low toxicity, the International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified itas possibly carcinogenic to humans. In addition, as a component of environmental pollution, carbonblack can cause oxidative damage and an inflammatory reaction, which further mediate genotoxicity,reproductive toxicity, neurotoxicity and diseases of the respiratory and cardiovascular systems [166,167].Nevertheless, carbon black is currently used as a filler in tires and in other rubber products, and as apigment in inks, paints and plastics.Composites of nanocellulose and carbon black have been used mainly for constructing biosensors,particularly wearable sensors for strain and human body motion, e.g., motion of the fingers, the elbowjoint and the throat. A strain-sensing device with excellent waterproof, self-cleaning and anticorrosionproperties was based on a superhydrophobic electrically conductive paper. This paper fabricatedby dip-coating a printing paper into a carbon black/carbon nanotube/methyl cellulose suspensionand into a hydrophobic fumed silica suspension [33]. Another strain-sensing device was fabricatedby printing carbon black conductive nanostructures on cellulose acetate paper. At the same time,this material had electrochemical properties promising for the detection of hydrogen peroxide [31].An electrochemical aptasensor for detecting Staphylococcus aureus, e.g., in human blood serum, wasdesigned as a nanocomposite of Au nanoparticles, carbon black nanoparticles and cellulose nanofibers,and was endowed with a thiolated specific S. aureus aptamer as a sensing element [32].7. Potential Cytotoxicity and Immunogenicity of Nanocellulose/Nanocarbon CompositesThe vast majority of studies dealing with potential biomedical applications ofnanocellulose/nanocarbon composites have reported no cytotoxicity or negligible cytotoxicity183Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 196of these composites, namely of nanocellulose/fullerene composites [35], nanocellulose/graphenecomposites [68,69,72,87,107], nanocellulose/CNT composites [51,149] and nanocellulose/nanodiamondcomposites [58,62,97]. Composites containing other carbon nanoparticles, such as activated carbonnanoparticles [30] or carbon quantum dots [28] have also shown no significant cytotoxic effects. In thementioned studies, cytotoxicity was mainly tested in vitro on various cell types, such as fibroblasts,epithelial and endothelial cells, and mainly on cell lines, including tumor cell lines. The cell viabilityand proliferation were usually evaluated by tests of the activity of mitochondrial enzymes, such asMTT assay, resazurin (Alamar Blue) assay, or by a direct microscopic examination of the cells. Somecomposites have also been tested in vivo, e.g., in a rat model (nanocellulose/CNT composites; [106]), acanine model (nanocellulose/CNT composites; [52]), or using a chick chorioallantoic membrane model(nanocellulose/graphene composites, [107]), without adverse effects.However, the individual components of nanocellulose/nanocarbon composites, particularly carbonnanoparticles, can act as cytotoxic, if they are not bound to any matrix and are free to move. Grapheneand graphene-based carbon nanomaterials, such as fullerenes and nanotubes, are hydrophobic intheir pristine state, and can enter into hydrophobic interactions with cholesterol in the cell membrane,which can be extracted from the membrane. In this manner, carbon nanoparticles can damage cellseven without penetrating them. Another mechanism of cell membrane damage is the generation ofreactive oxygen species (ROS) by carbon nanoparticles. In addition, the nanoparticles can penetrate thecell membrane, and can cause oxidative damage to mitochondria, and can also enter the cell nucleusand act as genotoxic agents (for a review, see [10,12,19,20]). Nanodiamonds have been consideredto be relatively nontoxic in comparison with other carbon nanoparticles. However, as shown in ourearlier studies, hydrophobic, hydrogen-terminated and positively-charged diamond nanoparticlescan enter the cells, impair their growth and cause cell death [152,156]. The mechanism of cell damageby nanodiamonds is by generating ROS, and by excessive delivery of sodium ions adsorbed on thenanodiamond surface [168]. Last but not least, carbon nanoparticles can be immunogenic, i.e., theycan activate inflammatory reactions, which can be, as has been demonstrated on carbon black, themain pathogenic mechanism of respiratory, cardiovascular and other serious diseases [166,167].Cellulose nanoparticles, which are generally considered to be biocompatible [34,114] and of alow ecological toxicity [169], can also act as cytotoxic and immunogenic. It has even been speculatedthat, due to their high aspect ratio and stiffness, CNCs may cause similar pulmonary toxicity ascarbon nanotubes and asbestos [170]. In a mouse model, cellulose nanocrystals induced oxidativestress, caused pulmonary inflammation and damage, increased levels of collagen and transforminggrowth factor-beta (TGF-β) in lungs, and impaired pulmonary functions [170]. In addition, theseeffects were markedly more pronounced in female mice than in male mice. The immunogenicity ofCNCs was also proven in vitro. CNCs and their cationic derivatives CNC-aminoethylmethacrylate andCNC-aminoethylmethacrylamide evoked an inflammatory response in mouse macrophage J774A.1cells and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells by increasing the level of ROS in mitochondria, therelease of ATP from mitochondria and by stimulating the secretion of interleukin-1beta (IL-1β) [171].The cytotoxicity and immunogenicity of CNCs depend on the preparation conditions and areincreased under harsh and caustic conditions, e.g., the so-called mercerization process, i.e., analkali treatment [149]. CNFs can also cause cytotoxicity and oxidative damage, which can be evenmore pronounced than in the case of CNCs, and can evoke an inflammatory response (for a review,see [2,172]). The potential cytotoxicity and immunogenicity of nanocellulose, nanocarbon and theircomposites should therefore be taken into account when they are for use in biomedical applications.8. ConclusionsNanocellulose/nanocarbon composites and other hybrid materials containing cellulosenanoparticles (nanofibrils or nanocrystals) and carbon nanoparticles (fullerenes, graphene, carbonnanotubes, nanodiamonds and other carbon nanoparticles) are novel materials that are promising fora wide range of applications in industry, (bio)technology and medicine. This is due to their unique184Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 196properties, such as high mechanical strength coupled with flexibility and stretchability (compositeswith graphene, carbon nanotubes and nanodiamond), shape memory (composites with grapheneand carbon nanotubes), photodynamic and photothermal activity (composites with fullerenes andgraphene), electrical conductivity (composites with graphene and carbon nanotubes), semiconductivity(composites with boron-doped diamond), thermal conductivity (composites with graphene andnanodiamonds), tunable optical transparency (composites with single-walled carbon nanotubes andnanodiamonds), intrinsic fluorescence and luminescence (composites with graphene quantum dotsand carbon quantum dots), and high adsorption and filtration capacity (composites with graphene,carbon nanotubes and carbon quantum dots). These properties arise mainly from the advantageouscombination of nanocellulose and nanocarbon, which associates and enhances the desirable effectsof each of these components. These materials can be prepared relatively easily from a water-basedsuspension, which is advantageous particularly for biomedical applications. These applications includedrug delivery, biosensorics, isolation of various biomolecules, electrical stimulation of damaged tissues,and particularly tissue engineering (bone, neural and vascular) and wound dressing. Our results haveproven supportive effects of nanocellulose/carbon nanotube composites on the adhesion and growthof human and porcine adipose tissue-derived stem cells, particularly under dynamic cultivation in apressure-generating lab-made bioreactor (see Appendix A). However, it should be pointed out that thebiomedical applications of nanocellulose/nanocarbon composites are associated with the risk of theirpotential cytotoxicity and immunogenicity, although this risk appears to be lower than for the singlecomponents of these materials.Author Contributions: All authors have read and agree to the published version of the manuscript.Conceptualization, L.B., S.S. and A.S.; methodology, J.P., M.T., R.M., J.S., S.P., A.S., S.S.; software, R.M., J.S.,A.B.; validation, L.B., R.M.; formal analysis, L.B., A.B., A.S., S.S.; investigation, J.P., M.T., R.M., J.S., S.P., A.S.,S.S.; resources, L.B., P.K.; data curation, J.P., R.M., A.B., A.S.; writing—original draft preparation, L.B., J.P., R.M.;writing—review and editing, A.B., A.S., S.S., P.K.; visualization, J.P., M.T., R.M., A.B.; supervision, L.B., P.K.;project administration, L.B.; funding acquisition, L.B.Funding: This research was funded by the Czech Science Foundation (grant no. 17-00885S).

In these experiments, a PurCotton® cellulose mesh (Winner Industrial Park, Shenzhen,China) was modified with an aqueous dispersion of positively-charged (i.e., cationic) wood-derivedCNFs, described in our earlier review article [2], and MWCNTs. Two types of composite sampleswere prepared, namely the samples with “thick” and “thin” coating of the fibers in the cellulosemesh. For thick coating, square-shaped samples of the cellulose mesh were fully immersed in anaqueous suspension of CNFs+MWCNTs, and during this immersion, the samples were homogeneouslyimpregnated with the nanoparticles. For thin coating, only one corner of the cellulose sampleswas submerged into the CNF+MWCNT suspension, which resulted in infiltration of the suspensionthroughout the cellulose mesh by capillary forces. Both types of samples were then dried for 5 h at 60◦C. Both types of samples displayed a grayish color, which was more intense in samples with a thickcoating. A pure CNF coating was prepared similarly to the thick coatings, and the meshes withoutcoating were used as a control.185Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 196The samples were sterilized by UV light (20 min for each side), fixed into CellCrowns™ inserts(Scaffdex Ltd., Tampere, Finland), placed into 24-well cell culture plates (TPP, Trasadingen, Switzerland)and seeded with human adipose tissue-derived stem cells (hASC) or porcine adipose tissue-derivedstem cells (pASC). Human ASC were isolated from subcutaneous fat tissue, obtained by liposuctionfrom the abdominal region of healthy female donors after their informed consent, under ethical approvalissued by the Ethics Committee of Hospital “Na Bulovce” in Prague, and in compliance with the tenetsof the Declaration of Helsinki on experiments involving human tissues. The isolation was described inmore details in our earlier studies [173,174]. Porcine ASC were isolated by enzymatic disintegration ofsubcutaneous fat tissue samples obtained by excision from laboratory pigs in collaboration with theInstitute of Clinical and Experimental Medicine (IKEM) in Prague, Czech Republic. Characterizationof cells by flow cytometry revealed the positivity of cells for standard surface markers of ASCs, namelyCD105, CD90, CD73 and CD29 in hASC, and CD105, CD90, CD29 and CD44 in pASCs. The ASCs fromboth species were negative or almost negative for hematopoietic markers, such as CD34 and CD45,and for CD31, an endothelial marker [174,175].The cells were seeded on the material samples at a density of 50,000 cells per well into 1.5 mL ofthe culture media. Human ASCs were cultivated in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM;Life Technologies, Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with 10% of fetal bovine serum (FBS; Life Technologies,Gibco), 40 μg/mL of gentamicin (LEK, Ljubljana, Slovenia) and 10 ng/mL of recombinant humanfibroblast growth factor basic (FGF2; GenScript, Piscataway, NJ, USA). Porcine ASCs were cultivatedin Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s Medium (Low glucose, Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) andHam’s Nutrient Mixture F12 medium (DMEM/F 12, Sigma-Aldrich Co.) in a ratio of 1:1 with 10% offetal bovine serum (FBS; Life Technologies, Gibco), 1% Antibiotic Antimycotic solution (Sigma-AldrichCo.) and 10 ng/mL of recombinant human fibroblast growth factor basic (FGF2; GenScript).After one or seven days of cultivation, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde(Sigma-Aldrich Co.) for 20 min, and 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich Co.) diluted inphosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was applied for 20 min at room temperature in order to permeabilizethe cell membranes. Nonspecific binding sites for antibodies were then blocked by a solution of 1%bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS (all Sigma-Aldrich Co.). Vinculin, a protein of focaladhesion plaques associated with integrin adhesion receptors, was visualized by treating the samplesfor 1 h at 37 ◦C with primary antibody against human vinculin (V9131, monoclonal mouse antibody,clone hVIN-1, Sigma-Aldrich Co.), diluted in the blocking solution (1% albumin and 0.1% Tween20 in PBS) in a ratio of 1:200. After washing with PBS, the samples were incubated for 1 h at roomtemperature in the dark with a secondary antibody, i.e., goat anti-mouse F(ab’)2 fragments of IgG (H +L), conjugated with Alexa Fluor® 488 (A11017; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA; Thermo FisherScientific, Waltham, MA, USA), diluted in PBS to a ratio of 1:400. Finally, cytoskeletal F-actin filamentswere stained by phalloidin conjugated with tetramethylrhodamine isothiocynate (TRITC) fluorescentdye (Sigma-Aldrich Co.), diluted in PBS to a final concentration of 5 μg/mL, for 1 h at room temperaturein the dark. Microscopy images were acquired using spinning disk confocal system Dragonfly 503(Andor, Belfast, UK) with Zyla 4.2 PLUS sCMOS camera (Andor, Belfast, UK) mounted on microscopeLeica DMi8 (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) with objective HC PL APO 20x/0.75 IMM CORRCS2; Free Working Distance = 0.66 mm or HC PL APO 40x/1.10 W CORR CS2; Free Working Distance= 0.65 mm.We found that the initial adhesion and subsequent growth of cells, evaluated by the cell numberand spreading on days 1 and 7, were similar on all coated samples. There was no apparent differencebetween samples coated with thick and thin layers of CNFs + MWCNTs and samples coated onlywith CNFs. However, all types of coatings markedly improved the adhesion and growth of cells incomparison with a pure uncoated cellulose mesh (Figure A1). In general, the cell growth was relativelyslow in all tested samples. On day 7, the cell number in all tested samples was only slightly higher thanon day 1. In addition, hASCs grew slightly better than pASCs, particularly on samples coated withCNFs+MWCNTs. Therefore, we decided to cultivate pASCs on the tested samples under dynamic186Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 196conditions, which are known to improve the growth of cells by their mechanical stimulation, by abetter supply of nutrients and oxygen and by quicker waste removal.Figure A1. Human adipose tissue-derived stem cells (hASC) and porcine adipose tissue-derived stemcells (pASC) on days 1 and 7 after seeding on a cellulose mesh with thick or thin CNF+MWCNT coating(column (a) and (b), respectively), with CNF coating (column (c)), and without any coating (column(d)). Cells were stained by immunofluorescence for vinculin (green), with TRITC-conjugated phalloidinfor F-actin (red) and with Hoechst #33258 for the nuclei (blue). Cellulose mesh had autofluorescencein the blue channel. Dragonfly 503 spinning disk confocal microscope with a Zyla 4.2 PLUS sCMOScamera, objective HC PL APO 20x/0.75 IMM CORR CS2. Scale bar: 50 μm.The dynamic cultivation was held in a unique lab-made cultivation chamber (Figure A2). Thischamber allows for fixing a standard well plate with tested substrates and its hermetical sealing tomaintain the desired pressure. This chamber was connected to a custom pressure stimulator. Thisstimulator consists of a servo-controlled linear stage with piston pump and special controlling software.This software allows for setting stimulation parameters that include high/low pressure, motor speed,pulsatile frequency and the shape of the pressure wave.Porcine ASCs were seeded on CellCrown-fixed substrates in 24-well plates at the same numberand in the same cultivation medium as mentioned above. Afterwards, the well plate for dynamiccultivation was fixed into the cultivation chamber, and this chamber was sealed and connected to thepressure stimulator. In the initial phase, the cells were left for 24 h without any pressure stimulationin order to allow their adhesion to the materials. The system was opened through a 220-nm filter toatmosphere forced with slow motion of pump piston to equilibrate CO2 level and pH of medium.After this resting phase, the pressure stimulation was set to 15.9/10.6 kPa (120/80 mmHg) high/lowpressure with frequency of 1 Hz (60 pulses per minute) with triangular pulse shape with 1:1 ratio. Thisdynamic cultivation lasted for 72 h (96 h of cultivation in total including the 24-h rest phase). Staticcontrol samples were cultivated for 96 h in a well plate with standard lid in the same CO2 incubator asthe dynamic samples.187Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 196Figure A2. Lab-made dynamic cultivation system for pressure stimulation of cells on the tested materialsamples. The whole system in a cell incubator (a); detail of a cultivation chamber (b).We found that dynamic cell cultivation markedly improved the adhesion and subsequent growthof pASCs. The cells were better spread and their number after three days of dynamic cultivation(day 4 after seeding) was markedly higher than in the corresponding samples incubated under staticconditions for four days (Figure A3), and also for seven days (Figure A1). The improvement incell colonization by dynamic cultivation was observed particularly on samples with thin CNF +MWCNT coating. On both thick and thin CNF +MWCNT coatings, the cells under dynamic conditionswere distributed almost homogeneously, while on the pure CNF coating, the cells tended to formclusters. A similar picture was observed in our earlier study performed on human dermal fibroblastsin four-day-old static cultures on the same cationic CNFs, where the cells were less widespread anddistributed less homogeneously than on anionic CNFs [2]. Therefore, it can be concluded that theaddition of MWCNTs to cationic CNFs improved the colonization of the material with pASCs underdynamic cell culture conditions.Figure A3. Porcine adipose tissue-derived stem cells (pASC) cultivated in a conventional static cellculture system for four days or in a pressure-generating dynamic cell culture system for three days(after one day of static cultivation). The cells were grown on a cellulose mesh with thick or thinCNF + MWCNT coating (column (a) and (b), respectively), with CNF coating (column (c)), andwithout any coating (column (d)).

Here, hybrid aerogels are assembled fromcellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) and carbon nanomaterials to remove cationic dye methylene blue (MB)and anionic dye Congo red (CR) in single and binary systems. Two classes of carbon nanomaterials,carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene nanoplates (GnPs), are incorporated into CNFs with variousamounts, respectively. The adsorption, mechanics and structure properties of the hybrid aerogels areinvestigated and compared among different combinations. The results demonstrate CNF–GnP 3:1hybrid exhibits the best performance among all composites. Regarding a single dye system, both dyeadsorptions follow a pseudo-second-order adsorption kinetic and monolayer Langmuir adsorptionisotherm. The maximal adsorption capacities of CNF–GnP aerogels for MB and CR are 1178.5 mg g−1and 585.3 mg g−1, respectively. CNF–GnP hybrid show a superior binary dye adsorption capacitythan pristine CNF or GnP. Furthermore, nearly 80% of MB or CR can be desorbed from CNF–GNPusing ethanol as the desorption agent, indicating the reusability of this hybrid material. Hence, theCNF–GnP aerogels show great promise as adsorption materials for wastewater treatment.Keywords: cellulose nanofibrils; graphene nanoplates; carbon nanotubes; aerogel; organic dyes;adsorption1. IntroductionDyes are colored organic chemicals typically classified as anionic (acid, reactive, and direct dyes),cationic (all basic dyes), and non-ionic (dispersed dyes) based on their charge upon dissolution inaqueous solutions [1]. These complex molecules are widely used in many industrial fields, such as textile,paper, leather tanning, food processing, plastics, cosmetics, rubber, and printing. The contamination ofthe hydrosphere with dyes raises serious environmental and sanitary concerns due to their ubiquity,toxicity and deleterious effects on photosynthetic activity in aquatic life due to decreased sunlightpenetration [2]. Particularly, methylene blue (MB), one of the most widely used basic dyes in theprinting and textile industries, can cause a variety of harmful effects, such as eye burns, gastrointestinaltract and skin irritation [3]. As a typical direct azo dye, Congo red (CR) is mainly applied in a relativelylarge dosage for dyeing biological samples, and can increase the risk of cancer if absorbed into thehuman body [4]. Currently, there are various industrial methods for treating waste dye solutions,including adsorption, microbial treatment, chemical oxidation or reduction, flocculation precipitation,ozone oxidization, chemical precipitation, nanofiltration, catalytic degradation etcetera [5–7]. Due toNanomaterials 2020, 10, 169; doi:10.3390/nano10010169 www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials199Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 169its simple operation and low cost, adsorption is widely used as a commercial way to remove organicdyes from aqueous solutions [8].Recently, carbon nanomaterials have attracted a broad interest in pollutant adsorption.Among them, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are comprised of one or several sheets of hexagonally packedcarbon atoms rolled into concentric seamless cylinders; these exhibit strong mechanical properties, a highaspect ratio, excellent chemical stability and a large specific surface area, which make them desirablefor dye adsorption [9–11]. The adsorption mechanism of organic compounds on carbon nanomaterialscan be described as an interplay between different intermolecular forces (i.e., hydrophobic, van derWaals forces, π–π bonding, hydrogen bonding, and electrostatic interactions), whose contributionsdepend on the adsorbate nature and the surface chemistry of the nano-adsorbent [12]. Anothertype of carbon nanomaterial, graphene, is a planar honeycomb-shaped nanomaterial consisting ofsix-member rings with a large specific surface area (theoretical value of 2630 m2 g−1) [13]. It is moreeasily prepared than CNT and shows an extensive application prospect in the removal of organic andinorganic pollutants [14] and dyes [15,16]. Graphene could be modified to adsorb pollutants via π–π,electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding. However, the cost of a carbon-based nano-adsorbentis high and the regeneration treatment of spent materials is often challenging [17]. Due to strongπ–π bonds and van der Waals forces, graphene sheets tend to condense and restack. CNTs oftengroup into bundles and tangle due to the same reason. Therefore, the available specific surface area ofthese carbon nanomaterial is much lower than the theoretical value, greatly restricting their practicalapplications [18]. Thus, providing a recycling function and reducing the aggregation potential of thecarbon nanomaterials are vital ways to design high-efficiency adsorbents.Nanocelluloses are a class of renewable nanomaterials derived from the most abundant naturalpolymer on earth. Their high specific surface area, bioavailability and surface reactivity makenanocelluloses interesting materials for pollutant adsorbents [19]. Since unmodified nanocellulosesexpose abundant surface hydroxyl groups and perhaps other negatively charged groups such assulfate or carboxylate groups depending on the preparation procedure [20,21], they are well-suited forthe adsorption of cationic molecules. Recently, high surface-area cellulose nanofibril (CNF) aerogelsprepared via 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpyperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO) oxidation were shown to absorb cationicmalachite green (MG) dye (212.7 mg g−1) due to electrostatic interactions between MG and negativelycharged oxygen moieties on the CNF surface [22]. To make nanocellulose adsorbents for anionicdye, chemical modifications, such as introduction of positively charged amino groups, are usuallyrequired [23]. However, these positively charged nanocelluloses are no longer suitable for cationicdye adsorption.While the above studies demonstrate the individual efficacy of carbon nanomaterials andnanocellulose adsorbents, improved adsorption performance and cost optimization may be realized bycombining these nanomaterials together. Since carbon nanomaterials and nanocellulose exhibit differentaffinities for given molecules; hence, their combination can increase the variety of pollutants thatmay be adsorbed. Recently, CNFs were shown to improve the dispersion of carbon nanotubes [24,25]and graphene [26] in aqueous solutions. Hajian et al. [26] suggested the charges on the TEMPOoxidized CNFs induced an electrostatic stabilization of the CNF–carbon nanomaterial complexes toprevent aggregation. When oxygen-containing carbon nanomaterials, such as graphene oxide (GO) oroxidized CNTs, were used, there was a strong interaction between the oxygen-containing groups ofcarbon nanomaterials and hydroxyl groups of nanocellulose [27]. Recently, Wei et al. [27] synthesizedGO/microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) aerogels in an LiBr aqueous solution. Hybrid GO/MCC aerogelhad higher adsorption capacity of MB per unit mass of GO (2630 mg g−1) than pure GO when thecontent of GO was low (0.3 wt%). Hussain et al. [28] fabricated GO/CNF monoliths based on aurea-assisted self-assembly method. The maximum adsorption capacity of these hybrid monolithsto MB achieved 227.27 mg g−1. Wu et al. [29] exploited cellulose nanofiber as a cross-linker tointerweave between reduced graphene oxide (rGO) layers and obtained hybridized monolith aerogelsby a hydrothermal method. The hybridized monolith was able to adsorb not only hydrophilic dyes,200Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 169but also hydrophobic organic oil. To our knowledge, the influence of carbon nanomaterials features,such as their morphology (nanotubes or nanoplates), on the adsorption behaviors of the CNF/carbonnanomaterial hybrids have not been explored.Concerning industrial wastewater, different types of dyes could be found. Most of the previousworks focus on single solute adsorption in pure water and are not representative of real-worldwastewater effluents. During this study, two types of carbon nanomaterials, CNTs and graphenenanoplates (GnPs), are dispersed in water with CNFs using different mass ratios, respectively, to preparehybrid aerogels through a simple freeze-drying procedure without the assistance of other agents.The aim is to understand the interactions of CNT and GnP with CNF and to explore the adsorptioncapacity of these hybrid materials to both anionic and cationic dyes in single and binary systems.The preparation, characterization, and adsorption assessments of CNF–CNT and CNF–GnP aerogelsfor MB and CR dyes are reported. Adsorption behaviors of dyes are inspected by kinetic models andadsorption isothermal models. The adsorption mechanism, contact time, and concentration of MB andCR dye to hybrid aerogels are investigated. Furthermore, desorption of both dyes from the adsorbentsare studied.2. Materials and Methods2.1. MaterialsRice straw was harvested at the South China Agricultural University in 2016. Benzene (99.5%,AR, Damao Chemical Reagent Factory, Tianjin, China), ethanol (99.7%, AR, Guangzhou ChemicalReagent Factory, Guangzhou, China), sodium chlorite (NaClO2, 80%, Aladdin), acetic acid glacial(CH3COOH, 99.5%, AR, Guangzhou Chemical Reagent Factory), potassium hydroxide (KOH, 85%,AR, Shanghai RichJoint Chemical Reagents, Shanghai, China), hydrochloric acid (HCl, 1 N, certified,Guangzhou Chemical Reagent Factory), sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 96%, Guangzhou ChemicalReagent Factory), sodium hypochlorite (NaClO, 8.0%, AR, Damao Chemical Reagent Factory),2,2,6,6-tetramethylpyperdine-1-oxyl (TEMPO, 98%, Aladdin), sodium bromide (NaBr, 99.9%, AR,Tianjin Fuchen Chemical Reagent Factory, Tianjin, China), methylene blue (MB, AR, Tianjin FuchenChemical Reagent Factory), Congo red (CR, Tianjin Fuchen Chemical Reagent Factory), graphenenanoplates (GnPs, Aldrich, grade C-750, thickness: a few nm, particle size: <2 μm, specific surface area:750 m2 g−1), and OH-functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs, Cheap Tubes, externaldiameter: 50–80 nm, internal diameter: 5–10 nm, length: 10–20 μm, OH content: 5.5%, specific surfacearea: 60 m2 g−1 [30]) were used as received. The chemical formula, maximum absorption wavelengthand electrical property under neutral pH of MB and CR are shown in Table S1. The deionized (DI)water used was purified by an AIKE Advanced-II-OS water purification system (Cheng Du KangningScience and Technology Development Company, Chengdu, China).2.2. Preparation of Cellulose NanofibrilsPure cellulose was prepared from rice straw by extracting wax and dissolving lignin, hemicelluloseand silica [31]. Cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) were prepared by TEMPO mediated oxidation employing5 mmol NaClO per gram of cellulose followed by mechanical blending at 37,000 rpm for 30 min [32].TEMPO-mediated oxidation converted the C6 primary hydroxyls on the surface of the celluloseinto carboxyls [33]. The successive mechanical treatment disintegrated oxidized cellulose fibers intoindividual nanofibrils that were 1–5 nm in width and hundreds of nanometers to 2 μm in length [32].The carboxylate content of the CNF was measured using a conductometric titration (Oakton CON6+, Cole-Parmer Instrument Company, Vernon Hills, IL, USA) following a previous method (Gu andHsieh, 2015) (Figure S1). The carboxylate (COOH + COO−) content was determined to be 1.36 mmol/gat neutral pH (COOH content: 0.137 mmol/g).201Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 1692.3. Preparation of CNF, CNF–CNT and CNF–GnP AerogelsCNTs or GnPs were added to CNF dispersions with various mass ratios of CNF to carbonnanomaterial (1:0, 3:1, 1:1, 1:3 and 0:1). The final concentration of all the mixtures was controlled to be6 mg mL−1. The mixtures were sonicated by ultrasonic cell disruptor (SCIENTZ, IID, Ningbo, China)at 600 W for 30 min in an ice bath. Each sample was frozen at −21 ◦C for 4 h in a 15 mL polypropylenecentrifuge tube followed by freeze-drying at −50 ◦C. The CNF–CNT and CNF–GnP hybrid aerogelswere obtained. Pure CNF aerogel also was obtained via the same method from a CNF suspension of 6mg mL−1.2.4. CharacterizationThe dispersion quality of aqueous CNT/CNF and GnP/CNF mixtures after sonication was examinedby depositing a drop of each suspension on a glass slide for optical microscope observations. The sizeof the aggregates was measured and averaged over 150–200 particles. Regarding the compressiontest, the aerogel samples were transferred into a chamber with a temperature of 25 ± 2 ◦C and arelative humidity of 65 ± 2%. The compressive strength of the samples was measured 24 h laterwith a compression ratio of 1 mm min−1 on a universal mechanical testing machine (CMT1000, SUST,Zhuhai, China). The morphology of CNF, CNF–CNT, CNF–GnP aerogels and CNT, GnP powder wasobtained by a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, SU-70, Hitachi, Chiyoda, Japan)after sputtering coating the samples with gold at 15 mA for 2 min under vacuum conditions (Hitachi,E-1010 Ion Sputtering System, Japan). Imaging of the samples was performed at 0.5–30 kV accelerationvoltage and 1–2 nA current intensity at magnifications of 20–800,000 times. The chemical structures ofCNF, CNF–CNT, CNF–GnP aerogels and CNT, GnP powder were characterized by Fourier transforminfrared spectroscopy (FTIR, PerkinElmer, Spectrum 100, Waltham, MA, USA) scanning from 4000 to400 cm−1 with a resolution of 4 cm−1. Before FTIR measurements, 2 mg dry sample was ground intopowder with 200 mg KBr and pressed into pellets. The specific surface area (SSA) of the samples wascalculated using Equation (1) [34].SSA =NAAMB(Co −Ce)VMMBMS(1)where NA is Avogadro’s number (6.023 × 1023 mol−1), AMB is the covered area per MB molecules(typically assumed to be 1.35 nm2), Co and Ce are the initial and equilibrium concentration of MB,respectively, V is the volume of the MB solution, MMB is the relative molecular mass of MB, and MS isthe mass of the sample.2.5. Adsorption of Dyes in Single SystemsAnionic dye CR and cationic dye MB were used in the adsorption experiment. CNF, CNF–CNT,CNF–GnP were aerogels, while pristine CNT and GnP were in the form of powder. Aqueous phaseadsorption studies were conducted at 25 ◦C by submerging 5 mg of a specific nano adsorbent into 20 mLof each dye solution at neutral pH. The mixture was continuously agitated on an orbital shaker at 120rpm and the amount of residual dye in the solution was determined by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy(UV-Vis, Thermo Scientific, Evolution 201, Waltham, MA, USA) at the maximum absorption wavelengthusing a measured extinction coefficient from a Beer’s law analysis for each solution. The adsorptioncapacity of MB, CR on each adsorbent was calculated using Equation (2).qt =(C0 −Ct)Vm(2)where qt is the amount of dye adsorbed at a given time (mg g−1), C0 is the initial dye concentration(mg L−1), Ct is the residual dye concentration at a given time (mg L−1), V is the solution volume (L),and m is the mass of the adsorbent (mg).202Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 169The effect of contact time (0–240 min) was examined using 5 mg of adsorbent and an initial dyeconcentration of 10, 250 and 500 mg L−1 for MB and 100, 600 and 2000 mg L−1 for CR. The effect of initialdye concentration on the final adsorption capacity was investigated in a range of dye concentrations(MB: 10, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 400, 500, 600, 800 and 1000 mg L−1; CR: 10, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250,300, 400, 500, 600, 800, 1000, 1500 and 2000 mg L−1) using an adsorbent of 5 mg at 25 ◦C and 120 rpmfor 16 h.2.6. Adsorption of Dyes in Binary SystemsMB and CR were added into 20 mL DI water with various mass ratios at a total concentration of200 mg L−1. The mass ratio of MB to CR was 3:1, 1:1 or 1:3. An adsorbent of 5 mg was added, and themixture was agitated at 25 ◦C and 120 rpm for 16 h. Regarding a binary system, dye A (MB) and dye B(CR) concentrations were calculated as follows:CA =kB2d1 − kB1d2kA1kB2 − kA2kB1 (3)CB =kA1d2 − kA2d1kA1kB2 − kA2kB1 (4)where d1 and d2 are the mixture optical densities measured at λ1 (664 nm) and λ2 (498 nm), respectively.kA1, kB1, kA2, and kB2 are the calibration constants for components A and B at wavelengths of λ1 andλ2, respectively [35,36].2.7. Desorption of DyesDesorption of MB and CR from CNF, GnP and CNF–GnP 3:1 was performed in ethanol, acetonitrile,acetone or 400 mM NaCl at 25 ◦C. First, the adsorbents were added into 20 mL of 100 mg L−1 dyesolutions for adsorption at 120 rpm and then taken out from the dye solutions after 16 h. Theseadsorbents were transferred to 20 mL of desorption agents. After 1h, the adsorbents were removed andthe dye concentration in the solution was measured. The adsorbents might again have been transferredto a fresh desorption agent and the desorption step was repeated for several cycles. Dye percentageremoval (%) was calculated by Equation (5):Removal (%) =DtC0 −Ce × 100 (5)where Dt is the concentration of dye in the desorption (mg L−1), C0 and Ce are the initial and finalconcentrations of dye in the adsorption (mg L−1), respectively.3. Results and Discussion3.1. Effect of Adsorbent StructureFigure 1 shows the uptake of MB or CR after 16 h with constant agitation on different nanosorbents.The initial MB and CR concentrations were 500 mg L−1 and 2000 mg L−1, respectively. Pure CNFadsorbed the highest amount of cationic MB per unit mass (1207.2 mg g−1) due to the large quantity ofnegatively charged carboxyl groups present on its surface. However, the amount of CR adsorbed onpure CNF was low (175.5 mg g−1) possibly due to Coulombic repulsions between negatively chargedCNF and anionic CR. Pure GnP powder (1491.7 mg g−1) was able to adsorb the highest amount of CRfollowed by pure CNT powder (777.9 mg g−1). The ability of GnP to remove MB was also superior toCNT, which can be attributed to the larger surface area of GnP with more sites available for adsorption.Compared to nanocellulose, carbon nanomaterials could adsorb both cationic and anionic dyes mainlythough π–π interaction [37]. Among the hybrid aerogels, CNF–GnP aerogels were generally better thanCNF–CNT aerogels in the ability to remove both types of dyes from water at the same CNF to carbon203Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 169nanomaterial ratio. Moreover, the adsorption capacity of MB onto CNF–GnP 3:1 (1166.1 mg g−1) wasvery close to that of pure CNF. As the quantity of carbon nanomaterials in the hybrid increased, theMB uptake gradually decreased because CNF was displaced by nano adsorbents with lower affinityfor MB. Interestingly, among all hybrid aerogels, CNF–GnP 3:1 also exhibited the highest CR uptake(507.1 mg g−1), almost two times greater than pure CNF. Similar results were obtained for CNF–CNThybrids, with CNF–CNT 3:1 having superior MB and CR uptakes than other CNF–CNT combinations.This may suggest that high CNF concentrations can reduce carbon nanomaterial aggregation andimprove dispersion quality to promote more effective contact between the solute and the sorbent.t-test results indicated the adsorption of MB onto CNF–GnP 3:1 and CNF–CNT 3:1 had no significantdifference (p > 0.01), but CNF–GnP 3:1 was superior to CNF–CNT 3:1 in the adsorption of CR (p< 0.01) (Tables S2–S5). Based on these observations, hybrid aerogels comprising a CNF to carbonnanomaterial ratio of 3:1 were selected for further dispersion, mechanics, morphology, and chemicalstructure analysis. The CNF–CNT 3:1 and CNF–GnP 3:1 sorbents are reported henceforth as CNF–CNTand CNF–GnP, respectively. Figure 1. The final adsorption of MB and CR onto CNF–CNT aerogels with the mass ratio of 1:0, 3:1,1:1, 1:3 and 0:1 (a), CNF–GnP aerogels with the mass ratio of 1:0, 3:1, 1:1, 1:3 and 0:1 (b). Initial MBconcentration was 500 mg L−1. Initial CR concentration was 2000 mg L−1.The dispersion states of CNT and GnP aqueous suspensions in the presence of CNFs wereinvestigated by optical microscopy after probe sonication for 5 min and 30 min (Figure S2). After 5 minof ultrasonic treatment, the average particle sizes of CNTs and GnPs were 8.8 ± 13.1 μm (Figure S2a)and 6.6 ± 11.0 μm (Figure S2c), respectively. After 30 min of ultrasonic treatment, large particleaggregations disappeared in each case (Figure S2b,d). The average particle sizes of CNTs and GnPswere 2.1 ± 0.5 μm and 3.1 ± 0.9 μm, respectively. The hydrophobicity of carbon nanomaterials andtheir tendency to readily form aggregates by hexagonal packing of individual particles with high vander Waals binding energy can greatly reduce the surface area available for adsorption. Ultrasonicationprovided sufficient energy to break the aggregates of carbon nanomaterials. While TEMPO-oxidizedCNFs had negatively charged surface carboxyls, the counterions on the surface of the CNFs induceddipoles in the sp2 carbon lattice of the carbon nanomaterials. Then, the charges on the CNFs inducedelectrostatic stabilization between CNF and CNT/GnP that prevented the carbon nanomaterials fromreaggregation [26]. Van der Waals interactions also may occur between CNF and CNT/GnP. CNTscontained few hydroxyl groups and were able to form hydrogen bonds with CNFs. The homogeneousCNF/CNT and CNF/GnP suspensions remained stable for at least 12 h, which was long enough for thepreparation of the hybrid aerogels.Pure CNF aerogel was white with a porous external structure and turned black with theincorporation of carbon nanomaterials (Figure 2, inset). The aerogels formed inside centrifuge tubesduring freeze-drying remained intact as cylindrical blocks and could be easily cut into slices using a204Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 169sharp blade with no apparent deformation. The compression stress-strain curves of the three aerogelsare shown in Figure 2. All curves exhibited “slow slope type” before the strain reached 80%. The initialstrength of CNF and CNF–GnP aerogels was similar and higher than that of CNF–CNT. After thestrains reached 80%, the curves were “steep type”. Inflection points were observed when the strainswere approximately 80%. Under the strains of 80%, the compression strengths of CNF, CNF–CNT andCNF–GnP were 0.064, 0.014 and 0.036 MPa, respectively. When immersed in water after compressiontesting, CNF, CNF–CNT and CNF–GnP aerogels exhibited a water activated shape recovery property(Supplementary Movies S1–S3). The aerogels absorbed water and restored the deformation. Most ofthe water could be easily squeezed out with tweezers and the compact aerogels could reabsorb waterand return to their original size and shape. The fact that the aerogel cylinders were easily squeezed to~10% of their length and quickly regained the same dimensions with a complete recovery, indicate thatthe aerogels were mechanically strong, and their open structure allowed the liquid solution to rapidlyand freely flow in and out.Figure 2. Stress–strain curves of CNF, CNF–CNT and CNF–GnP. The inset is a photograph of thefreeze-dried aerogels. 1: CNF, 2: CNF–GnP and 3: CNF–CNT.The morphologies of the CNF, CNT, GnP, CNF–CNT and CNF–GnP adsorbents have beencharacterized by SEM (Figure 3a–h). Pure CNF aerogel exhibited a three-dimensional structure with anintercalation of flat and folded sheets and contained pores of various shapes, which may be ascribedto the high suspension concentration (i.e., 6 mg mL−1) used before freeze-drying. Pristine CNT andGnP powders revealed the presence of bundles and stacked aggregates due to strong attractive forcesbetween individual particles (Figure 3c,d). The combination between CNT and CNF affected theformation of the CNF sheet structure (Figure 3e). This is the reason that CNF–CNT aerogel producesdebris after compression performance testing (Supplementary Movie 2). CNT dispersed better in theCNF matrix (Figure 3f). However, at higher magnification (Figure 3f, inset), some CNT aggregatescould be observed still in the matrix. Since both CNFs and CNTs were anisotropic rods, and CNTswere much longer than CNFs, individual CNT partly uncovered by CNFs may re-associate with eachother during the freeze-drying process. Thus, the CNT surface active sites available for dye adsorptionwere reduced. CNF–GnP formed porous aerogels with the main framework still being composedof CNF, while granular GnPs were evenly distributed in the CNFs matrix after ultrasonication andfreeze-drying (Figure 3g,h). This can be attributed to the strong interactions between CNF and GnP,preventing GnP stacking and improving the hydrophilicity of GnPs [38]. The graphene platelets werewell separated by rod-like CNFs. To contrast with the irregular and aggregated structure of CNT andGnP powders, the hybrid aerogels exhibited an open pore network that can facilitate fast moleculardiffusion, hence promoting the accessibility of adsorption sites to relatively large dye molecules.Noteworthy, the morphology of CNF–GnP aerogels was quite different from the curly morphology ofpure graphene aerogel in a previous study [39].205Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 169 Figure 3. FE–SEM images of CNF aerogel (a,b), CNT (c), GnP (d), CNF–CNT aerogel (e,f) and CNF–GnPaerogel (g,h). The insets in (c,d,f,h) are FE–SEM images of CNT, GnP, CNF–CNT and CNF–GnP at ahigh magnification, respectively.206Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 169The FTIR spectra of CNF, CNF–CNT, CNF–GnP, CNT and GnP are shown in Figure 4. The CNFspectrum showed common cellulose peaks: broad hydroxyl stretching at 3360 cm−1 and bending at1610 cm−1, predominant C–O peaks at 1168, 1112, and 1062 cm−1, and a C–H stretching peak at 2900cm−1, respectively. The small shoulder at 1712 cm−1 was associated with the carbonyl stretching of thecarboxylic acid, confirming C6 primary hydroxyl conversion to carboxyls from TEMPO oxidation [21].The CNT and GnP spectra were nearly featureless. A small bump at 1570 cm−1 was assigned to C=Cgroups in graphene. Bending vibrations of C–O–C at 1210 cm−1 and C–O at 1038 cm−1, respectively,indicated epoxide or C–OH structure existing in CNT and graphene. These weak vibration peaksconfirmed that the degree of oxidation in CNT and GnP were low. The cellulose characteristic peaksalso were observed in the hybrid aerogels containing 25% CNT/GnP. The change of wavenumber forO–H in the hybrids indicated the existence of hydrogen bonding between CNT/GnP and CNF [40].Since CNT and GnP only had few oxygen containing groups, van der Waals forces and, perhaps,hydrophobic interactions also contributed to the combination of the carbon nanomaterials and CNFs. Figure 4. FTIR spectra of CNF (a), CNF–CNT (b), CNF–GnP (c), CNT (d) and GnP (e). To optimize therepresentation, the region of 2500–1800 cm−1 is omitted.Based on adsorption, dispersion, mechanics, morphology and IR results mentioned above, the bestperformance of the CNF–GnP 3:1 hybrid aerogel perhaps resulted from the plate structure and largesurface area of GnPs (i.e., The specific surface areas of GnP and CNT were 750 and 60 m2, respectively).A sufficient amount of CNFs prevented GnPs from stacking and improved the hydrophilicity of GnPs.However, CNTs still tangled with each other in the CNF matrix. Dye molecules adsorbed to the GnPportion mainly through π–π and hydrophobic interactions, while cationic MB was able to adsorb to thenegatively charged CNF portion by electrostatic interactions. Thus, CNF–GnP 3:1 aerogel was selectedfor future adsorption kinetics and isothermal modeling.3.2. Effect of Contact Time and Adsorption KineticsThe effect of CNF, CNF–GnP and GnP contact time (25 ◦C, 120 rpm) on dye removal was studiedat low, medium and high initial dye concentrations (Figure 5). The initial MB concentrations were 10,250 and 500 mg L−1 and the initial CR concentrations were 10, 600 and 2000 mg L−1. The adsorption ofMB dye onto CNF, CNF–GnP and GnP occurred rapidly during the first 30 min, then leveled beyond207Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 16960 min at all initial MB dye concentrations. The adsorption of CR dye onto CNF, CNF–GnP and GnPoccurred at a lower speed compared to that of MB. The adsorption onto CNF and CNF–GnP slowedwith adsorption time and reached a plateau beyond 90 min at all initial CR concentrations. However,the adsorption onto GnP still increased very slowly even after 120 min at all initial CR concentrations. Figure 5. Effects of contact time on the dye removal efficiencies of MB and CR using CNF, CNF–GnPand GnP. Initial MB dye concentration: 10 mg L−1 (a), 250 mg L−1 (b), 500 mg L−1 (c). Initial CRconcentration: 100 mg L−1 (d), 600 mg L−1 (e), 2000 mg L−1 (f). Pseudo-second-order adsorptionkinetics was applied for all conditions in (a–f).Adsorption kinetics models can be employed to predict the equilibrium adsorption capacity andelucidate the adsorption mechanism. During the adsorption process, the dye molecules migratedfrom the aqueous solution onto the surface of the adsorbent. MB molecules were adsorbed throughelectrostatic interactions. The electrostatic interactions occurred when the cationic dye MB wasclose enough to the adsorption sites (–COO−, –OH) on the adsorbent surface. CR molecules wereadsorbed mainly through π–π bonding and hydrophobic interactions with carbon nanomaterials.208Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 169Accompanying the increase in contact time, the accumulation of dye molecules on the adsorbentsurface gradually increased and eventually reached equilibrium. The adsorption kinetics of MB andCR on different absorbents was evaluated using both the Lagergren’s pseudo-first-order and the Ho’spseudo-second-order models. The Lagergren’s pseudo-first-order kinetics is expressed as Equation(6) [41]:qt = qe(1− e−k1t) (6)where k1 is the rate constant (min−1), qt is the amounts of dye absorbed at a given time (mg g−1), andqe is the amount of dye adsorbed at equilibrium (mg g−1). Nonlinear regression analysis was used toassess the values of qe, k1. The Ho’s pseudo-second-order kinetics was expressed as Equation (7) [42]:qt =q2ek2t1 + qek2t(7)where k2 is the pseudo-second-order rate constant (g mg−1 min−1). Nonlinear regression analysis wasused to assess the values of qe, k2. The initial adsorption rate v0 at t = 0 could be calculated usingEquation (8):v0 = k2 × qe2 (8)Regarding all adsorbents, the pseudo-second-order model was generally more applicable fordescribing the adsorption of MB, as demonstrated by the higher correlation coefficients (R2), comparedto the first-order kinetics (Table 1). This result was consistent with previous reports of cationic dyesadsorbed onto pure CNF [22] and pure graphene [43]. The initial MB adsorption rate (v0) and MBdye adsorption capacity (qe) increased rapidly with increasing original dye concentrations from 10to 250 mg L−1 for all adsorbents. Further increasing of the original MB concentration from 250 mgL−1 to 500 mg L−1 resulted in an increase of v0 for pure GnP, while v0 did not change significantlyin the cases of pure CNF and CNF–GnP hybrid. This phenomenon may be attributed to the limitedamount of negatively charged adsorption sites on the CNF surface at longer contact times and higherMB concentrations. Although the adsorption of MB onto CNF–GnP sorbent was relatively slower thanthat on each component alone, the hybrid aerogel exhibited the highest theoretical MB adsorptioncapacity (qe = 1264.5 mg g−1) at a high initial MB concentration (i.e., 500 mg L−1).The pseudo-second order kinetic model was also clearly a better fit for the adsorption of CR ontopure GnP, which is consistent with a previous study [44]. However, the sorption of CR onto pure CNFcould be described as either pseudo first-order kinetics or pseudo second-order kinetics, as indicated bythe similar R2 (0.94–0.98) for both models. Occurring at neutral pH, both CR and CNF were negativelycharged. Adsorption of CR onto CNF was relatively low and possibly resulted from hydrophobicinteraction. The adsorption of CR onto the CNF–GnP hybrid also could be represented by either thefirst-order or second-order model and exhibited much higher uptake values than pure CNF. This resultpossibly indicates that in the hybrid material, CNF did not significantly affect the adsorption kineticsof GnP, even though the GnP content was relatively small. Both the CR adsorption rate (v0) and CRadsorption capacity (qe) increased with increasing the initial dye concentrations from 100 to 2000 mgL−1 for all adsorbents. The augmentation of the initial concentration provided a greater driving forcefor the mass transfer and subsequent adsorption on the nanomaterials [45]. The theoretical qe value forCNF–GnP reached 648.5 mg g−1 at a high initial CR concentration, 2.5 times higher than pristine CNF(182.4 mg g−1).209Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 169Table 1.

Effect of Initial Dye Concentration and Adsorption IsothermThe effect of initial dye concentration on the adsorption capacity was investigated in the10–1000 mg L−1 and 10–2000 mg L−1 ranges for MB and CR, respectively. The systems weremixed at 25 ◦C and 120 rpm for 16 h and equilibrium was declared when there was no appreciablechange in solution concentration with additional contact time. Concerning all adsorbents, at lowdye concentration, adsorption increased dramatically with increasing concentration (Figure 6). Theadsorption of MB reached a plateau when residual MB concentration was above 200 mg L−1 in allcases. The final MB adsorption at equilibrium for CNF–GnP was 1207.5 mg g−1 at the initial MBconcentration of 1000 mg L−1. The adsorption of CR increased relatively slowly when the residual CRconcentration was above 400 mg L−1 in all cases. The final CR adsorption at equilibrium of CNF–GnPwas 507.1 mg g−1 at the initial CR concentration of 2000 mg L−1.To further understand the mechanism of adsorption, the adsorbed quantities and residual dyesin the solution at equilibrium were fitted with isothermal models. The adsorption isotherm modelsdescribe the interaction between the adsorbate and adsorbent. Three models, Langmuir, Freundlichand Sips, were used to obtain the isotherm parameters for adsorption of dyes onto CNF, GnP, CNF–GnP.The Langmuir isotherm equation is expressed as follows [46]:qe =qmaxKLCe1+KLCe(9)210Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 169where qe is the equilibrium adsorption amount per unit weight of the adsorbent (mg g−1), Ce is theequilibrium concentration of adsorbate in the solution (mg L−1), qmax is the maximum amount of thedyes adsorbed per unit weight of the adsorbent (mg g−1), which describes the complete single-layercoverage on the surface of the dye at a high equilibrium concentration of dyes, and KL is the Langmuiradsorption equilibrium constant related to binding site affinity (L g−1), representing the bondingenergy of adsorbent and adsorption product. The Langmuir isotherm model is based on the monolayersorption on a surface with a finite number of identical sites and uniform adsorption energies. Figure 6. Adsorption of MB (a) and CR (b) to CNF, CNF–GnP and GnP. The Langmuir adsorptionmodel was applied for data fitting.The Freundlich isotherm equation is expressed as below [47]:qe = KF ×C1ne (10)where KF (mg g−1) and n are the Freundlich constants. The Freundlich isotherm model is an empiricalequation for understanding the adsorption of heterogeneous surfaces with multiple adsorption layers.KF and n are related to adsorption capacity, adsorption strength and spontaneity, respectively. Whenthe value of n is within the range of 1< n <10, it indicates a good adsorption process. The larger nvalue, the better the adsorption effect.The Sips isotherm equation is given as follows [48]:1qe=1qmaxKs(1Ce)1n+1qmax(11)where qmax is the Sips constant related to maximum adsorption capacity (mg g−1), KS is the isothermconstant of Sips related to adsorption energy (L g−1), and n is the heterogeneity factor. The Sips modelis a combination of the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms. As KS approaches 0, the Sips isothermequation follows the Freundlich model. When n approaches or equals 1, the Sips isotherm equation isreduced to the Langmuir isotherm.The fitting parameters of each model are listed in Table 2. According to the correlation coefficients(R2), both the Langmuir and Sips adsorption models could adequately describe the dye adsorptionon each adsorbent, while the Freundlich isotherm model was the least suitable. Since the Sips modelis derived from the Langmuir equation, employs one more fitting parameter, and yields similarcorrelation coefficients, it could be concluded that the Langmuir model is more appropriate to describethe adsorption behavior. The Langmuir fitting curves for the adsorption of MB and CR on the differentadsorbents are shown in Figure 6. The binding constant KL is related to the adsorption energy betweenthe adsorbent and the dye. MB displayed higher binding constants (GnP: 7.0 × 10−2 L g−1, CNF: 8.3× 10−2 L g−1, CNF–GnP: 1.1 × 10−1 L g−1) than CR (GnP: 7.1 × 10−3 L g−1, CNF: 8.6 × 10−4 L g−1,211Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 169CNF–GnP: 3.8 × 10−3 L g−1) regardless of the adsorbent nature, indicating a higher binding affinityto MB. Compared to the other dye-adsorbent complexes, the uptake of MB on CNF–GnP was themost favorable. The Langmuir model revealed that both MB and CR adsorbed as a monolayer onthe CNF–GnP surfaces, with maximum adsorption capacities of 1178.5 mg g−1 and 585.3 mg g−1,respectively. According to Equation (1) and the monolayer adsorption, the specific surface areas (SSA)of CNF and CNF–GnP were determined to be 3220.4 and 3036.1 m2 g−1, respectively. Theoretically, ifCNF is assumed to be a perfect cylinder with a 1 nm diameter (cellulose density: 1.5 g/cm3), the surfacearea of CNF is 2667 m2/g. The high SSA determined by MB adsorption indicates CNFs contained alarge number of micropores.Table 2.

Table 3 presents acomparison of the maximum dye adsorption capacity of different adsorbents. CNF–GnP was able toadsorb both cationic MB and anionic CR and yielded higher uptake values compared to recent studiesusing cellulose, activated carbon, graphene, and CNT-based composites.Table 3.

Adsorption of Dyes in Binary SystemsRegarding industrial wastewater, different types of dyes could be found and they compete for theadsorption sites on the surface of the adsorbent. To investigate the adsorption capacity of CNF–GnP ina more practical setting, an MB and CR binary system was prepared and investigated. The mass ratioof MB to CR in the solution was designed to be 3:1, 1:1 and 1:3. The total initial dye concentration wasset to be 200 mg L−1. The adsorption of dye in single and binary systems was compared (Figure 7).Shown in Figure 7a, when the mass ratio of MB to CR was 3:1 (i.e., MB = 150 mg L−1, CR = 50 mg L−1),the adsorption of MB onto pure CNF in the binary system was lower than that in the single system,indicating MB and CR competed for adsorption sites on the CNF surface. However, the adsorption ofMB onto pure GnP and CNF–GnP was similar in both the single and binary systems. The adsorption ofCR onto all adsorbents increased in the binary system compared to that in the single system. This maybe attributed to the Coulombic attraction between cationic MB adsorbed on the material surface andanionic CR in solution. Similarly, when the mass ratio of MB to CR was 1:1 (Figure 7b), the adsorptionof MB was lower and the CR uptake for pure CNF and CNF–GnP was higher in the binary systemthan in the single system. However, the adsorption of CR onto pure GnP was strongly affected bythe presence of MB when the CR concentration increased. Moreover, when CR became the dominantmolecule in the binary system (i.e., MB to CR ratio was 1:3, Figure 7c), the CNF–GnP hybrid wasable to adsorb even more CR than pure GnP. Regarding all binary systems, the adsorption capacityof CNF–GnP was the best among the different nano adsorbents, and the presence of one dye had nonegative impact on the adsorption of the other dye. The hybrid CNF–GnP adsorbed the highest amountof MB and CR combined per unit mass of adsorbent. Perhaps the cationic MB and anionic CR adsorbedonto different types of adsorption sites on the CNF–GnP surface. The cationic MB mainly adsorbedonto the negatively charged CNF portion, while most of the CR adsorbed onto the GnP portion. MBadsorbed on the material surface also may attract anionic CR in solution via Coulombic attraction.Figure 7. Adsorption of MB and CR in single and binary dye solution. (a) mass ratios of MB toCR are 3:1; (b) mass ratio of MB to CR are 1:1; (c) mass ratio of MB to CR are 1:3. Colored barsrepresent adsorption in a single dye system. Colorless bars represent adsorption of one dye in a binarydye system.213Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 1693.5. DesorptionThe desorption of MB and CR from CNF, GnP and CNF–GnP by ethanol, acetonitrile, acetone and400 mM NaCl was investigated. The desorption of dye adhered onto CNF, GnP and CNF–GnP wasnot effective using acetonitrile, acetone and NaCl. Upon immersion in acetonitrile, acetone or 400 mMNaCl for 1 h, only 23.6%, 17.2% or 28.3% of pre-adsorbed MB in CNF–GnP hybrid (100 mg L−1 MB,20 mL MB solution, 16 h) was desorbed, respectively. Upon immersion in acetone or 400 mM NaCl,only 6.0% or 20.1% of pre-adsorbed MB in GnP was desorbed. Concerning CNF, only 36.6% MB wasdesorbed by acetone. Although 400 mM NaCl could desorb 88.6% MB under the same conditions, thepure CNF aerogel could not remain intact after immersion for 1 h. Strong ionic conditions destroyedthe hydrogen bonding network in pure CNF. Dyes adhered to CNF, GnP and CNF–GnP were desorbedrapidly by ethanol (Figure 8). Desorption of MB and CR adhered to CNF–GnP by ethanol was relativelymore effective. After 1h of immersion, 42.4% of the MB and 51.0% of the CR were desorbed fromCNF–GnP by ethanol. Finally, after four rounds of desorption, 79.2% of the MB and 78.3% of the CRwere desorbed. Anhydrous ethanol is a protic solvent that contains polarized oxyhydrogen bondswhich ionize to form alkoxyl negative ions and protons (hydrogen ions). It can provide lone pairelectron interaction with MB (cationic dye) molecules. Concurrently, anhydrous ethanol also canprovide protons with CR (anionic dye) molecules to form hydrogen bonds. The rapid desorptionof both MB and CR demonstrate that the CNF–GnP hybrid aerogel could be easily regenerated forrepeated dye removal applications.Figure 8. Cyclic desorption of MB (a) and CR (b) with CNF–GnP, CNF, GnP by ethanol.4. ConclusionsHybrid aerogels containing TEMPO oxidized cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) and carbonnanomaterials (carbon nanotubes (CNTs) or graphene nanoplates (GnPs)), were designed andsynthesized by freeze-drying to remove organic dyes from single and binary systems. When theCNF to GnP mass ratio was 3:1, the hybrid aerogel exhibited the most effective adsorption of bothmethylene blue (MB) and Congo red (CR) among all the hybrid systems tested. The final adsorptioncapacities of CNF–GnP 3:1 aerogels for MB and CR reached 1166.1 mg g−1 and 507.1 mg g−1 at initialdye concentrations of 500 mg L−1 and 2000 mg L−1, respectively. The CNFs enhanced the dispersionof carbon nanomaterials in an aqueous environment. The hybrid aerogels were mechanically strongand exhibited water-activated shape recovery. Seen in a single dye adsorption system, the adsorptionability measurements demonstrate that the CNF–GnP 3:1 aerogel possessed the adsorption capacityand adsorption rate close to CNF aerogels in cationic MB solutions. The adsorption capacity andadsorption rate of CNF–GnP aerogels was more efficient than the CNF aerogel in an anionic CRsolution. Dye adsorptions to CNF–GnP followed a pseudo-second-order adsorption kinetic and theexistence of CNF did not affect the adsorption kinetics of GnP. The adsorption followed a monolayer214Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 169Langmuir isotherm. Concerning a binary system, the CNF–GnP aerogel removed cationic MB as wellas anionic CR at a higher total dye adsorption capacity than pristine CNF or GnP. Moreover, 79.2%and 78.3% of the MB and CR were desorbed from CNF–GnP by using ethanol as the desorption agent,suggesting the reusability of this hybrid material. Results of this study indicate that CNF–GnP showpromise as high-potential adsorbents for organic dye removal.Supplementary Materials: The following are available online at http://www.mdpi.com/2079-4991/10/1/169/s1,Figure S1: Conductometric titration curves of CNF (a) with HCl added and (b) without HCl added., Figure S2:Optical micrographs of (a) CNF/CNT 3:1 after 5 min ultrasonic treatment; (b) CNF/CNT 3:1 after 30 min ultrasonictreatment; and (c) CNF/GnP 3:1 after 5 min of ultrasonic treatment; (d) CNF/GnP 3:1 after 30 min ultrasonictreatment, Table S1: Chemical structure, molecular weight, maximum absorption wavelength and electricalproperty of methylene blue and Congo red.

Electro-conductive hydrogels (ECHs) are consideredto have great application prospects in portable energy-storage devices. However, the synergisticproperties of self-healability, viscoelasticity, and ideal electrochemistry are key problems. Herein,a novel ECH was synthesized by combining polyvinyl alcohol-borax (PVA) hydrogel matrix and2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO)-cellulose nanofibers (TOCNFs), carbon nanotubes(CNTs), and polyaniline (PANI). Among them, CNTs provided excellent electrical conductivity;TOCNFs acted as a dispersant to help CNTs form a stable suspension; PANI enhanced electrochemicalperformance by forming a “core-shell” structural composite. The freeze-standing composite hydrogelwith a hierarchical 3D-network structure possessed the compression stress (~152 kPa) and storagemodulus (~18.2 kPa). The composite hydrogel also possessed low density (~1.2 g cm−3), highwater-content (~95%), excellent flexibility, self-healing capability, electrical conductivity (15.3 S m−1),and specific capacitance of 226.8 F g−1 at 0.4 A g−1. The fabricated solid-state all-in-one supercapacitordevice remained capacitance retention (~90%) after 10 cutting/healing cycles and capacitance retention(~85%) after 1000 bending cycles. The novel ECH had potential applications in advanced personalizedwearable electronic devices.Keywords: cellulose nanofibers; carbon nanotube; polyaniline; hydrogels; supercapacitor1. IntroductionNowadays, with the rapid development of personal wearable electronic devices, miniaturizedenergy storage devices with mechanical flexibility and even self-healing functions have attracted moreand more attention; among them, the supercapacitor is a research hotspot [1,2]. The supercapacitoris a promising new energy storage device, which combines the advantages of high power fromdouble-electric layer capacitors and high energy from batteries [3]. However, traditional supercapacitorsNanomaterials 2020, 10, 112; doi:10.3390/nano10010112 www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials219Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 112are susceptible to various unavoidable mechanical deformations and cannot meet the needs of flexiblewearable electronic devices [4]. Therefore, flexibility and self-healing characteristics are requirementsfor wearable energy storage devices. In order to integrate flexibility, self-healability, and electrochemicalperformance into a supercapacitor device, searching suitable electrode and electrolyte material hasbecome a key to the manufacture of intelligent devices [5].Hydrogels are considered as ideal candidates because of their flexible three-dimensional (3D)networks, high deformability, and hydrophilic property [6]. Firstly, hydrogel polymer network withhigh-water content dissolves ions and provides high ion conductivity, which can be compared withthe ionic conductivity of a liquid while maintaining the solid shape and size to avoid liquid leakageduring various mechanical deformation. It is an ideal choice for flexible supercapacitor electrolyteand separator materials [7]. Secondly, electrically conductive hydrogel (ECH) is a new functionalmaterial that combines flexible 3D hydrogel network with conductive nano-fillers. Due to the inherentporous structure, excellent conductivity, and flexibility of the ECH, it is the perfect choice for flexibleelectrode materials. The continuous conductive network inside the ECH provides electron transferpathways. The hierarchical pore structure can ensure sufficient contact between the active material andthe electrolyte ions to improve the electrochemical performance [8]. Finally, a supercapacitor assembledfrom the hydrogel-based electrode and electrolyte, because of the inherent viscoelasticity and flexibilityof the hydrogel, will possess an improved interface between the electrode and the electrolyte [9].However, the related researches on self-healable and flexible hydrogel-based supercapacitors arelimited so far [2].A novel freestanding and moldable hydrogel with excellent self-healing performance wassynthesized by incorporating cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) into polyvinyl alcohol-borax (PVA)hydrogel matrix. Conductive materials were incorporated into self-healable PVA hydrogels to formmultifunctional ECHs, which had potential applications in flexible and self-healable supercapacitors.In our present study, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and polyaniline (PANI) were the electrochemicallyactive materials in electrodes. 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO)-cellulose nanofibers(TOCNFs) were the bio-dispersant that helped CNTs disperse in water. PANI was coated on thesurface of TOCNF-CNT nano-hybrids through in-situ oxidative polymerization to form “core-shell”TOCNF-CNT@PANI composites. These composites built a hierarchically reinforced and conductive3D network in the self-healable PVA hydrogel matrix. The hydrogel-based electrodes and electrolyteswere used to assemble symmetrical solid-state all-in-one supercapacitors with flexible and fastself-healable performances.2. Materials and Methods2.1. MaterialsBleached wood pulp was provided by Nippon Paper Chemicals Co., Ltd. (Tokyo,Japan). 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO, C9H18NO), sodium bromide (NaBr), sodiumhypochlorite solution (NaClO, 6–14% active chlorine), ammonium persulfate (APS, H8N2O8S2), anilinemonomers (ANI, C6H7N), Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), Potassium hydroxide (KOH), polyvinyl alcohol(PVA, Mw = 124,000–186,000 g mol−1, 99% hydrolyzed), sodium tetraborate decahydrate (Borax,Na2B4O7·10H2O, 99.5% purity) were purchased from Aladdin Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., Shanghai,China. The carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were obtained from Nanotech Port Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, China(the purity >97%; the diameter in the range 10–20 nm; the length in the range 30–100 μm). They wereall the analytical grade. Deionized (DI) water was used in all the preparations.2.2. Preparation of TOCNFs, TOCNF-CNT Nanohybrids, and TOCNF-CNT@PANI NanohybridsThe bleached wood pulp solution was mixed with TEMPO and NaBr by means of mechanicalstirring. Then, NaClO (15 mmol g−1 cellulose) solution was added to initiate an oxidation reaction.The value of pH should be maintained at 10.5 by adding 1 M NaOH solution in the reaction process.220Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 112After the oxidation reaction, the achieved fibers were washed by DI water and ultrasonicated at 800 Wpower for 3 min to obtain TOCNFs [10]. The concentration of final homogenized suspension wasadjusted to 0.6 wt%.A total of 0.5 g CNT powers was added to the 62.5 g 0.6 wt% TOCNFs suspensions at the massratios m(CNTs):m(TOCNFs) = 1:0.75 while keeping mechanical agitation for 30 min. Then, they werediluted to 500 mL water and ultrasonicated for 10 min at 400 W power in an ice bath to achieveTOCNF-CNT nanohybrids homogenized aqueous dispersion. The sonication was carried out by ahigh-energy ultrasonic cell disruptor.TOCNF-CNT@PANI nanohybrids were synthesized based on TOCNF-CNT nanohybrids as atemplate and APS as oxidant through in-situ polymerization in an acidic water medium, as follows.First, 50 mL 1 M HCl solution containing 0.875 g ANI (0.0094 mol) was added into the 500 mLTOCNF-CNT nanohybrids dispersions and stirred for 10 min in an ice bath. Next, 50 mL 1 M HClsolution containing 2.68 g APS (0.01175 mol, mole ratio of ANI:APS = 1:1.25) was added slowly tothe mixture in 30 min. During the process, the uniform mixture was slowly converted to blue tone,indicating polymerization; then, the solution was kept stirring for 6 h and stand for 12 h in an ice bathto complete polymerization. Finally, the obtained TOCNF-CNT@PANI nanohybrids were washed byvacuum filtration, and the excess unreacted ions were removed. The washed product was transferredto dialysis tubes and dialyzed to pH = 7.A similar method was used to synthesize TOCNF-CNT@PANI nanohybrids containing differentPANI content. The mass ratio of ANI monomers to TOCNF-CNT nanohybrids were 0:1, 1:1, 2:1,and 3:1, and the corresponding TOCNF-CNT@PANI nanohybrids samples were denoted TOCNF-CNT,TOCNF-CNT@PANI-1, TOCNF-CNT@PANI-2, and TOCNF-CNT@PANI-3, respectively.2.3. Preparation of TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA Composite HydrogelTwo grams PVA and 100 mL DI water were stirred for 1 h at 90 ◦C to achieve a transparentPVA aqueous solution. Then, the solution was added into TOCNF-CNT, TOCNF-CNT@PANI-1,TOCNF-CNT@PANI-2, and TOCNF-CNT@PANI-3 nanohybrids aqueous dispersion and stirredto form homogeneous dispersion, respectively. According to m (PVA):m (borax) = 4:1, boraxpowders were added slowly into the mixture with stirring at 90 ◦C until the compositebecame sticky. The composite showed viscoelastic performance slowly with the decrease oftemperature, indicating the formation of the final composite hydrogels. The correspondinghydrogels were named TOCNF-CNT/PVA, TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-1, TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-2,and TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-3, respectively.2.4. Fabrication of the Self-Healing Solid-State SupercapacitorThe supercapacitor device was a symmetric configuration, which was assembled by two pieces ofTOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-2 (5.0 × 1.5 × 0.1 cm3) and one piece of TOCNF/PVA (5.0 × 1.5 × 0.1 cm3).They were immersed into 6 M KOH solution for 12 h before assembling. In symmetricalsupercapacitors, the electrolyte and separator were TOCNF/PVA hydrogels, which were sandwichedin TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-2 hydrogels using as electrodes and current collectors. The interfacesbetween electrodes and separators could be completely glued into a single thin separating layeras excellent self-healing character, thereby manufacturing an integrated solid-state supercapacitor.The electrochemical measurements of supercapacitors were performed on an electrochemicalworkstation (CHI 760E, Shanghai, China).2.5. CharacterizationThe transmission electron microscope (TEM) was carried out by a transmission electronmicroscope (JEM-1400, Tokyo, Japan) operating at 120 kV. The concentrations of CNTs, TOCNF-CNT,and TOCNF-CNT@PANI water suspensions were 0.05–0.1 wt%. The absorption spectra of CNTs,TOCNF-CNT, and TOCNF-CNT@PANI suspensions were measured at room temperature using an221Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 112ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectrophotometer (Tu-1810, Purkinje Co., Beijing, China) at a wavelengthof 200–1000 nm. Spectra were collected using water as a reference at a scan speed of 0.5 nm s−1. Infraredspectra were performed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy (Nicolet iS50, ThermoFisher Scientific Inc., Madison, WI, USA) with attenuated total reflection (ATR) mode. The wavelengthrange was from 4000 to 500 cm−1 at a resolution of 4 cm−1. X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra wereobtained by an X-ray diffractometer (Ultima IV, Rigaku, Japan) at 40 kV and 30 mA, and the anglerange was 2θ = 5~40◦ at a scanning rate of 5◦ min−1. The microstructure of composite hydrogel wasobserved by a JSM-7600F scanning electron microscope (Nippon electronics Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) ata voltage of 15 kV.Uniaxial compression measurements were carried out through a universal mechanical testingmachine (CMT4304, Shenzhen, China) on a cylindrical sample (diameter of 20 mm; the height of 5 mm)at a compression speed of 8 mm min−1 at room temperature in air. The values of stress (σ) and strain(ε) were calculated from the force and deformation of the original size of samples. The compressiveelastic modulus (Ee) was calculated from the rake angle ratio of the linear part (ε < 20%) of the σ-εcurve. The specific stress (σs) was obtained by dividing the density (ρ). The energy absorption (Ea)was the integral area of the part under the σ-ε curve.Tensile stress-strain measurements were performed using a universal mechanical testing machine(CMT4304, Shenzhen, China) at a pulling rate of 20 mm min−1. The hydrogel samples of initial andhealed (20 s) in a size of 30 × 15 × 5 mm3 were nipped to the tensile machine during the testing process.All the tensile measurements were repeated for three times. The healing efficiencies (ηF) were calculatedfrom the break stress (Fhealed) of the healed hydrogel divided that of the initial one (Foriginal). The healingefficiencies (ηK) were defined from that the break strain (Khealed) of the healed hydrogel sample dividedthat of the initial one (Koriginal). (ηF = Fhealed/Foriginal × 100%, ηK = Khealed/Koriginal × 100%).The dynamic rheological properties, including dynamic frequency scanning, dynamic strainscanning, and continuous step strain, were tested by a Rheometer (HAAKE600, Waltham, MA, USA)with a plate diameter of 40 mm and a gap of 500 μm. The dynamic strain range was 0.01 to 100% withangular frequency (ω) of 1 Hz. The linear viscoelastic region (LVR) was decided by storage modulus(G′), and the G′ was independent of the strain in the LVR. In the following measurement of eachsample, 1% strain (γ) was selected to maintain the dynamic oscillatory deformation within the LVR.In dynamic frequency scanning measurement, the relationship between the shear storage modulus(G′), loss modulus (G′′), and angular frequency (ω) were recorded at ω = 0.1–100 rad s−1, γ = 1%, and25 ◦C. The complex modulus (G*) was calculated by Equation (1).G =√G′2 + G′′ 2 (1)Continuous step strain tests were conducted to study the recovery property of the hydrogelsunder the applied shear stress. A procedure to the program was as follows: 1% (800 s)→80% (800 s)→1% (800 s)→ 80% (800 s)→ 1% (800 s), the G′ and G′′ versus time were measured at ω = 1 Hz and 25 ◦C.Conductivity tests of hydrogel electrodes. A square-shaped hydrogel with a size of 1 × 1 × 10cm3 was sandwiched by two pieces of platinum electrodes. The resistance (R) values of the hydrogelwere decided by current-voltage (I–V) measurement using an electrochemical workstation (CHI 760E,Shanghai, China). The conductivity (σ) was achieved from Equation (2):σ =1× dR× S (2)where σwas the conductivity (S m−1), R was the resistance (Ω), d was the length (m), and S was thecross-sectional area (m2) of the sample, respectively.Electrochemical measurements of the hydrogel-based electrodes were performed on athree-electrode system using an electrochemical workstation (CHI 760E, Shanghai, China).The working electrode, the counter electrode, the reference electrode, and electrolyte were the222Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 112TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-2 hydrogel (1.5 g), platinum plate electrode, mercury/mercury oxide(Hg/HgO) electrode, and 6 M KOH aqueous solution, respectively. The cyclic voltammetry (CV)test was carried out at scan rates of 40 mV s−1 from −0.2–0.8 V, the galvanostatic charge-discharge(G-CD) test was performed over the voltage range of −0.2–0.8 V at a current density of 0.4 A g−1,and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) test was measured over the frequency range from 0.01 Hzto 100 kHz at open circuit potential (alternating current perturbation voltage was 5 mV). The specificcapacitance (Cs) values were calculated from the G-CD curves using Equation (3):Cs =IΔtmΔV(3)where Cs represented the specific capacitance (F g−1), I represented the discharge current (A), Δtrepresented the time of discharge (s), ΔV represented the voltage of discharge (V), and m representedthe mass of active materials (g).3. Results and Discussion3.1. Synthesis Process and Mechanism of TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA Composite HydrogelsThe preparation process of hierarchical 3D network TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA composite hydrogelis illustrated in Figure 1. Firstly, TOCNF suspensions were prepared through a TEMPO oxidationtreatment in an aqueous system following an ultrasonication treatment. TEMPO oxidizes thehydroxymethyl group at the glycose C6 position in the cellulose chain to a more active carboxylgroup [11]. Secondly, the homogeneous TOCNF-CNT nanohybrid dispersions were obtained bymixing CNT powders with TOCNF dispersions through ultrasonication. Not only the fluctuation ofcounter ions on the surface of TOCNF fibers induced the dipoles of the carbon lattice in CNTs,but also the carboxyl groups of TOCNFs produced electrostatic repulsion, which ensured thestabilization of CNTs in water [10]. Thirdly, TOCNF-CNT with excellent dispersibility and highspecific surface area were used as nanocarrier of PANI. TOCNF-CNT@PANI nanohybrids weresynthesized by in-situ chemical polymerization with APS as oxidant and TOCNF-CNT as a biologicaltemplate in acid medium. PANI formed a wholly uniform coating layer around TOCNF-CNTnanohybrid bundles (Figure 1d), which would bring enough pseudo-capacitance [12]. Finally,PVA and borax were introduced into the TOCNF-CNT@PANI nanohybrid dispersions to achieveTOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA composite hydrogel through cross-linking reaction. Borax would decomposeinto B(OH)4− ions in water, and B(OH)4− ions would create a reversible connection between theCNF-CNT@PANI composite fibers and the PVA molecular chains, forming a dynamic 3D networkstructure in the hydrogel [6]. The hierarchical 3D network inside hydrogel is illustrated in Figure 1e;the CNTs provided the fast electron transport path, and the nano-coating layer of PANI-ensuredelectrons could only pass through a very short distance to the CNT networks with high conductivity,which improved the electrochemistry of TOCNF-CNT@PANI nanohybrid. In addition, the borate ionscould combine with the adjacent hydroxyl groups to form dynamic cross-linking between PVA chainsand TOCNF-CNT@PANI nanohybrids. The dynamic PVA-borate cross-linking network providedhydrogel with the moldable and self-healing performance. The TOCNF-CNT networks provided anadditional platform to improve strength, toughness, and conductivity. The chain entanglement andhydrogen bonding between TOCNF-CNT@PANI nanohybrids and PVA formed a hierarchical 3Dnetwork in TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA hydrogels.223Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 112Figure 1.

Dispersion State and Chemical Analysis of TOCNF-CNT and TOCNF-CNT@PANI NanohybridsThe microstructure morphologies of CNTs, TOCNF-CNT, and TOCNF-CNT@PANI-2 nanohybridsare shown in Figure 2a–c. Due to the hydrophobic surface and strong van der Waals forces betweenCNT fibers, it was difficult for the pristine CNTs to disperse well in water [13]. It was clear to see thatpristine CNTs formed densely agglomeration and precipitation in water (Figure 2a and insert). Afterintroducing TOCNFs into CNT suspension, as shown in Figure 2b, the CNTs (length: 500–700 nm,diameter: 20–30 nm) dispersed in an individual form without aggregation in water with the help ofTOCNFs (length: 1 μm, diameter: 20–30 nm).Figure 2.

PANI particles were deposited on the surface of TOCNF-CNTnanohybrids, forming a continuous shell structure with a high aspect ratio. The in-situ depositedaniline fiber could grow a fresh polymer, then initiate the continuous growing process and forma block precipitate, and the initial seed morphology would be transcribed on a long scale [14].TOCNF-CNT@PANI composite fiber with a “core-shell” structure was the prototype of the 3Dhierarchical conductive network. The PANI grew along the TOCNF-CNT templates to form the“shell”, which was carried by TOCNF-CNT fibers, and dispersed in water to construct a hierarchical3D conductive network. It was noted that the continuous conductive networks fabricated byTOCNF-CNT@PANI composite fibers were obligatory to synthesize the ECHs with high conductivityand enhanced mechanical performances [15].The UV-vis spectroscopy of CNT, TOCNF-CNT, and TOCNF-CNT@PANI-2 complexes are shownin Figure 2d. Due to the poor dispersibility and high aggregation, the absorption peak of pureCNT suspension was much weaker than that of the TOCNF-CNT nanohybrids at the same CNTconcentrations (0.015 wt%), suggesting that TOCNFs improved significantly the dispersibility of CNTsin an aqueous medium. The absorption peak of TOCNF-CNT nanohybrids was around 262 nm in theUV-vis spectrum, which could be assigned to the π−π transitions of CNTs and showed a more uniformdispersion state of CNTs [16]. Two peaks of TOCNF-CNT@PANI-2 at 285 and 475 nm were from thetransition of π−π inter-band and the polaron band of PANI, respectively. The end band (~800 nm)of the TOCNF-CNT@PANI-2 complexes was smooth because of the cross-linking of polymer chains,indicating that it was successful in doping PANI into the conductive state [17].The FTIR spectra of TOCNFs, CNTs, TOCNF-CNT nanohybrids, TOCNF-CNT@PANI-2 composite,and TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-2 hydrogel is shown in Figure 2e. For all the samples, the broad bandsat around 3330 cm−1 and sharp bands at around 2900 cm−1 were generally due to O-H stretching of thehydrogen bonds and asymmetrically stretching vibration of C–H in the CH2 group, respectively [18–21].The peaks around 1000 cm−1 and 1600 cm−1 were ascribed to the C–O–C vibration and the carbonylfunctional groups of cellulose [22–24]. For the spectra of neat CNTs, the characteristic absorptionaround 1640 cm−1 was assigned to the quaking of the carbon skeleton [25,26]. For the spectra ofTOCNFs, the peaks at 1430 cm−1 and 1325 cm−1 were assigned to the hydrogen bonding and CH2wagging [27]. The typical absorption peak of TOCNF-CNT-2 nanohybrids was analogous to that ofTOCNFs, which was due to the absorption peak of TOCNFs covering the absorption peak of the CNTsin the FTIR spectra, revealing the CNTs were successfully combined with TOCNF bio-templates [28].Comparing with the spectra of pure CNTs, the C–O–C bending band shifted from 1100 cm−1 to1000 cm−1 (TOCNF-CNT-2 nanohybrids), confirming the existence of hydrogen bonding betweenTOCNFs and CNTs [29].After in situ polymerization, the peaks at 1430 and 1325 cm−1 were assigned to the C = C vibrationdeformation of the quinoid ring and benzenoid ring, respectively [30]. For TOCNF-CNT@PANI-2complexes, the N−H bonding vibration caused the major peaks at 3330 cm−1 shifted to lowerwavenumbers, indicating that the TOCNF-CNT nanohybrids were coated with PANI [31]. Further, thevanishing of the sharp band at 1600 cm−1 from the carbonyl functional groups of cellulose revealed thatPANI coated onto TOCNF-CNT nanohybrids successfully. For TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-2, the distinctpeaks at 1430 and 1325 cm−1 were attributed to the asymmetric B−O−C bonding, 840 cm−1 wasassigned as B–O bonding of free B(OH)4−, and 660 cm−1 was ascribed to B–O–B bonding in the boratemolecule networks, suggesting the presence of borax and borate [32], which further confirmed theexistence of borate cross-linking network between the PVA molecule chains, TOCNF−CNT@PANInanohybrids, and borate within the hydrogels [33].Figure 2f shows the XRD diffraction patterns of CNTs, TOCNFs, TOCNF-CNT nanohybrids,TOCNF-CNT@PANI-2 nanocomposite, and TOCNF-CNT/PVA-2 hydrogel samples. A diffractionpeak of CNTs at 2θ = 26◦ arose from interlayer spacing (002), reflecting the characteristic of graphite.The diffraction peak at 2θ = 43◦ arose from in-plane crystal lattice (100) [34]. In the XRD diffractionpatterns of TOCNFs, a sharp peak and a broad peak at 2θ = 22.2◦ and 15.0◦, attributed to (002) and (101)225Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 112planes, suggested the crystallization from cellulose I [22]. Comparing with the XRD profile of pureCNTs, the TOCNF-CNT nanohybrids showed two additional peaks at 2θ = 15.0◦ and 22.2◦, reflectingthe characteristic of cellulose I. These observations suggested that CNTs and TOCNFs were combinedand remained integrality [35].For the XRD spectra of TOCNF-CNT@PANI-2 nanocomposite, due to in situ polymerization ofANI monomers, the peaks located at around 2θ = 15.0◦ and 22.2◦ were wider than that of TOCNF-CNTnanohybrids, which could be attributed to the overlapping of diffraction peaks at 2θ = 19.4◦ and14.9◦ from (020) and (011) crystal planes of PANI [36]. The peak intensity at 2θ = 25.8◦ was enhanced,which was due to the overlapping of diffraction peaks of π-π stacking corresponding to the co-faciallystacked conjugated backbones from the polymer chains of PANI [37]. After the incorporation of PVAhydrogel, the peaks of CNFs at 2θ = 15◦ disappeared, and a broad new peak emerged at 2θ = 22.2◦,which contained the diffraction peaks at 2θ = 19.4◦ corresponding to the orthogonal lattice fromPVA with semi-crystalline structure. All these revealed the strong interactions between PVA, borax,and TOCNF-CNT@PANI-2 nanocomposite and built a 3D network in the composite hydrogels [38].3.3. Compression Test and Microstructures of HydrogelsFigure 3a shows the stress-strain curves of these hydrogels under compression.The measured stresses at the 90% strain level were 52.3 ± 0.3, 86.1 ± 3.9, 108.4 ± 4.3, and152.3 ± 5.1 kPa for TOCNF-CNT/PVA, TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-1, TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-3,and TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-2, respectively. Thus, the stress of TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-1 hydrogelwith PANI at the 90% strain level was almost 1.6-fold than that of TOCNF-CNT/PVA. PANI nanoparticlescombined with TOCNF-CNT nanofiber to form TOCNF-CNT@PANI composite fibers with a “core-shell”structure. The composite fibers based on good dispersibility and interfacial adhesion inside the hydrogeleffectively transferred the load, thereby improving the mechanical strength of PVA hydrogel [39].With the increase of PANI content, the stress of TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA increased first and thendecreased. The stress of TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-3 was 108.4 ± 4.3 kPa, which was lower thanthat of TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-2 with 152.3 ± 5.1 kPa. This phenomenon could be attributed tothe TOCNF-CNT biological template being insufficient to carry and disperse these excess PANI.Aggregated PANI prevented effective cross-linking between PVA and borax and disrupted the integrityof the network in the hydrogel. Under external force, the stress concentration caused by agglomerationwould weaken the mechanical strength [40].The TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-2 possessed the highest mechanical strength in all the hydrogels. Itsσvalue (152.3± 5.1 kPa) at ε= 90% and Ee value (61.0± 0.8 kPa) in theσ-ε curve were 2.9-fold and 4.2-foldmore than those (σ = 52.3 ± 0.3 kPa, Ee = 14.4 ± 0.3 kPa) of TOCNF-CNT/PVA hydrogel. The specificcompressive stress (σs) value of TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-2 was 128 kPa cm3 g−1, which was 2.8-foldlarger than that of TOCNF-CNT/PVA with 45.9 kPa cm3 g−1. In Figure 3b, TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-2had the largest energy absorption (Ea) value. In the Ea-ε curves of hydrogels, the Ea with ε = 90%was selected to compare the mechanical properties of hydrogels. In particular, the Ea value ofTOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-2 at ε = 90% was 3.2 ± 0.5 kJ m−3, which was approximately 4 times largerthan TOCNF-CNT/PVA with 0.8 ± 0.4 kJ m−3. All the values of strength and physical properties arecollected in Table 1.226Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 112Figure 3. (a) Stress-stain curves under compression; (b) energy absorption-strain curves of hydrogels;(c) SEM image of TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-2 composite hydrogel; (d) idealized 3D cross-linkingnetwork of TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-2 composite hydrogel.Table 1.

In addition, the CNTs wereentangled with each other to form a lot of contact junctions in the interstitial space between the PVAmolecular chain. These contact junctions built the continuous conductive network in the hydrogel matrix.Figure 3c shows the microstructure of TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-2 composite hydrogel, and Figure 3dpresents the schematic diagram of the 3D network structure. The composite hydrogel possessed aninterconnected porous structure, and each pore had a diameter of 200–500 nm. The wall of the porewas formed by a hydrogel matrix with a thickness of 10–30 nm. The entangled TOCNF-CNT@PANIcomposite fibers penetrated through the hole wall and built a hierarchical network. The specificframework could effectively promote the transport of electrons, improving the electrical conductivityof the hydrogel. Among them, TOCNFs were important to promote the formation of hierarchicalmicrostructure, which profited from their excellent natural characteristics of hydrophilicity, highaspect-ratio, mechanical strength, and flexibility. TOCNFs combined with CNTs through hydrogenbonding and chain entanglement and served as nanocarriers to disperse CNTs in aqueous media [13].The well-dispersed TOCNF-CNT nanohybrids were coated by PANI to form TOCNF-CNT@PANIcomposite fibers with “core-shell” structure. The composite fibers could further improve the mechanicalstrength and electrical properties of hydrogel [41]. The CNTs in composite fiber could effectivelytransfer the force from the PVA molecule chains. Moreover, an efficient and stable CNTs electric network227Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 112could improve the electrical conductivity of TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA composite hydrogel. The resultsshowed that the hierarchical network microstructure inside the composite hydrogel increased theinterface between the electrolyte and the electroactive material, demonstrating a broad applicationprospect in flexible electrodes.3.4. Dynamic Viscoelastic Performance of HydrogelsFigure 4a shows the G′ curves of hydrogel samples based on strain at ω = 1 Hz. Within theLVR, the G′′ and G′ of the hydrogel were independent of strain, as determined by dynamic strainscanning tests. The critical strain (γc) of hydrogel was a strain point, where the G′ value decreasedfrom the platform value by 5%, indicating deviation from LVR [38]. The G′ value correspondingto the strain higher than γc would gradually decrease, indicating that the quasi-solid hydrogel hadchanged to a quasi-liquid state. The γc values of TOCNF-CNT/PVA, TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-1,TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-2, and TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-2 were 2.5%, 2.1%, 1.2%, and 1.5%,respectively. Therefore, in the following dynamic oscillation measurement, the γc value was selectedas γ = 1%, which could ensure that deformations of the hydrogel samples were within the LVR. For allthe hydrogel samples in the LVR, the G′ values were independent of strain, and the correspondingG′max was 2.8, 4.1, 7.5, and 5.1 kPa, respectively (Figure 4a). The G′max of TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-1was 1.5 times that of TOCNF-CNT/PVA. TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-2 possessed the largest G′max(7.5 kPa), which was nearly 1.8-fold larger than TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-1 (4.1 kPa) and 1.5-foldgreater than TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-3 (5.1 kPa). Incorporation of an appropriate amount of PANIcould improve remarkably the stiffness of hydrogel. The shorter the LVR, the closer the samplewas to the solid-state. Compared with TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-1 and TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-3,it could be known that the TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-2 possessed a higher G′max and shorter LVR,indicating that TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-2 was the strongest hydrogel. The result was consistent withthe mechanical strength test.Figure 4. Dynamic viscoelastic properties of hydrogels at 25 ◦C. (a) storage modulus (G′) curvesbased on strain (γ) at angular frequency (ω) = 1 Hz; (b) G′ and loss modulus (G′′) curves based onω at γ = 1%; (c) complex modulus (G*) curves based on ω at γ = 1%; (d) stretching demonstration ofTOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-2 hydrogel.228Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 112In order to study the effect of TOCNF-CNT@PANI composite fiber on the viscoelasticity ofhydrogels, the G′ (elasticity) and G′′ (viscosity) of hydrogels versus ω at γ = 1% in the LVR areshown in Figure 4b. As shown, the G′ and G” curves of all the hydrogels followed similar trends.With the increase of ω, the G′ increased monotonically and arrived at plateau value (G′∞), indicatingthe formation of neighboring polymer chains entanglements; the G” increased preliminarily toreach the maximum value (G”max), then decreased gradually. For all the hydrogels, the G′ valueswere always higher than the G” values throughout the ω range, suggesting hydrogels showedtypical solid-like characteristics, indicating that a dynamic cross-linked network was establishedinside hydrogel [6,42]. The G′∞ and G”max values of TOCNF-CNT/PVA were 4.3 and 2.6 kPa,respectively. After the introduction of PANI, the G′∞ (6.1 kPa) and G”max (3.1 kPa) values ofTOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-1 were 1.4 and 1.2 times those of TOCNF-CNT/PVA, respectively. It wasshown that the combination of PANI and TOCNF-CNT to form a TOCNF-CNT@PANI composite fiberwith a “core-shell” structure could significantly improve the viscoelasticity of hydrogel. Comparingbetween TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-1, TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-2, and TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-3,the TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-2 showed the highest G′∞ (18.2 kPa) and G”max (7.6 kPa). Thesedata of dynamic viscoelastic properties are summarized in Table 2. It showed that an appropriateproportion of PANI could develop a hierarchical network structure and increase viscoelasticitytogether with TOCNF-CNT. However, excessive PANI would form aggregation due to insufficientTOCNF-CNT to disperse and load. A large amount of PANI blocked the cross-linking betweenPVA and borax, reducing the dynamic viscoelasticity of the hydrogel [33]. Figure 4c showsthe curves of complex modulus (G*) versus ω, which provided a clear contrast of viscoelasticity.The trend was TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-2> TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-3> TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-1> TOCNF-CNT/PVA within the entire range of ω. The TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-2 showed the highestG*, further proving that TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-2 was the most quasi-solid hydrogel among thesehydrogels. In Figure 4d, a piece of rubbery TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-2 hydrogel could be stretchedto 400% strain without damage, exhibiting excellent flexibility, viscoelasticity, and efficient energydissipation capability. Inside hydrogel, flexible PVA chains and long TOCNF-CNT@PANI compositefiber were physically entangled or hydrogen-bonded to build a 3D network, which could unravel andreconstruct the energy dissipating ability of the hydrogel.Table 2.

Self-Healing Performance of the HydrogelsThe composite hydrogel possessed a dynamic self-healing PVA-borate network, and theTOCNF-CNT@PANI composite fibers network provided an additional platform to strengthen thestructure [33]. In Figure 5a, the G′ and G” of TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-2 were 8.1 and 4.2 kPa at γ = 1%,respectively. The value of G′ was larger than that of G”, indicating that the elastic character of hydrogelbecame the dominant factor. When the strain increased to γ = 80%, the corresponding G′ and G” ofTOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-2 were 0.2 and 0.6 kPa, respectively. The value of G′ was less than that of G”,indicating hydrogel turned to the quasi-liquid state. Interestingly, when the strain dropped to 1% again,the corresponding G′ and G” immediately restored the original values, indicating that the hydrogelrecovered the quasi-solid state. The rapid and repeatable phase transition between the quasi-solid stateand quasi-liquid state demonstrated the intrinsic preeminent self-healing capability of the hydrogel.229Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 112To visualize the self-healing property of the hydrogel, two blocks of TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-2 werepushed together for 20 s, and their contact surfaces would fuse. In addition, after the self-healedhydrogel was stretched to 300% strain, there was no crack at the healing interface (Figure 5b).Figure 5. (a) The storage modulus (G′) and loss modulus (G”) dependence of time in continuous stepstrain measurements. (b) Illustration of self-healing property for TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-2 hydrogel.(c) Hydrogel stretching curve before and after 20 s self-healing. The solid lines represent the originalhydrogels, and the dashed lines represent the self-healed hydrogels. (d) Histogram of tensile stress ofthe original hydrogels and the self-healed hydrogels after healing in the air for 20 s.The stress-strain curves of hydrogels are shown in Figure 5c. The maximum break strainvalues of original TOCNF-CNT/PVA, TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-1, TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-2,and TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-3 were 450.5 ± 23.2%, 387.8 ± 19.0%, 345.1 ± 15.1%, and326.7 ± 12.5%, respectively. The highest tensile stress values of original TOCNF-CNT/PVA,TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-1, TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-2, and TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-3 were57.9 ± 2.1, 63.5 ± 2.5, 95.3 ± 3.2, and 72.9 ± 2.9 kPa, respectively. The TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-2composite hydrogel possessed the highest tensile stress, which was 1.6 times that of TOCNF-CNT/PVAhydrogel without PANI, indicating that the proper incorporation of PANI could effectively improve thetensile stress of composite hydrogels. This was consistent with previous measurements of mechanicalstrength and dynamic viscoelasticity.To calculate the self-healing efficiency of hydrogels, these self-healed hydrogels after 20 s healing inthe air were measured by a tensile test. The tensile curves of the self-healed hydrogels were basically thesame as that of the original hydrogels. The maximum break strain values of healed TOCNF-CNT/PVA,TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-1, TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-2, and TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-3 were443.8 ± 22.1%, 381.1 ± 18.0%, 338.5 ± 13.3%, and 321.0 ± 10.2%, respectively. The correspondingηk values were 98.5%, 98.3%, 98.1%, and 98.2%, respectively. The maximum tensilestress of healed TOCNF-CNT/PVA, TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-1, TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-2, andTOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-3 were 56.3 ± 2.0, 61.9 ± 2.4, 92.3 ± 3.7, and 69.7 ± 2.8 kPa, respectively.The corresponding ηF values were 97.2%, 97.5%, 96.8%, and 96.7%, respectively. These data of230Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 112dynamic viscoelasticity properties are summarized in Table 3, which demonstrated the outstandingself-healing property of as-prepared hydrogels with the dynamic borate-assisted cross-linking network.The complexation between borate and hydroxyl was extremely fast (0.33 s), and TOCNFs and PVAchains contained large number of hydroxyl groups so that the hydrogels could recover quickly [43].Table 3.

Conductivity Analysis of HydrogelsThe composite hydrogel not only possessed excellent mechanical properties and self-healingability but also possessed outstanding electrical conductivity due to the existence of CNTs andPANI in the hydrogels. The conductivity was quantitatively characterized by the I–V measurementat potential ranging from −4 to 4 V. In Figure 6a, the I–V curves of composite hydrogels are alllinear and non-hysteretic, indicating the excellent electro-conductive character. The conductivityof the TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-3, TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-2, TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-1, andTOCNF-CNT/PVA composite hydrogels were 15.3, 12.8, 8.2, and 6.4 S m−1, respectively. The valuewas superior to phytic acid cross-linked polyaniline/poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PANI/PNIPAM)conductive hydrogels (~0.8 S m−1) [15]. polyaniline-poly(styrene sulfonate) (PANI-PSS) hydrogels(~10−2 S m−1) strengthened by sorbitol derivatives (DBS) supramolecular nanofibers [40]. Theoretically,CNTs and PANI were the main active material of conductive network within the composite hydrogels.With PANI as the shell and CNTs as the core, a composite fiber with a “core-shell” structure wasformed. The electrical conductivity of the composite fiber was higher than that of bare CNTs fibers [44].The conductivity of hydrogel increased rapidly when the mass ratio of ANI to TOCNF-CNTs increasedfrom 1:1 to 2:1. However, the conductivity of hydrogel increased slowly, when the mass ratio of ANI toTOCNF-CNTs changed from 2:1 to 3:1. It could be concluded that a 2:1 ratio of ANI and TOCNF-CNTscould form the most perfect conductive network. As the ratio of ANI to TOCNF-CNT increased to 3:1,the TOCNF-CNT skeleton framework was insufficient to load excess PANI, which resulted in a slowincrease in conductivity. Consequently, the well-integrating and stability of the TOCNF-CNT@PANIconductive network with the “core-shell” structure offered an effective electron-transfer pathway inthe hydrogel. TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-2 was selected for the next experiment based on the previousmechanical test results.231Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 112Figure 6. (a) Current-voltage (I–V) curves of TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA with different dopingconcentrations of PANI. (b) I–V curves of TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-2 hydrogel after multiplecutting/healing cycles. (c) Cycling of the cutting/healing processes for TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-2 atthe same location under ambient conditions. (d) Time dependence of the electrical healing processby I-V measurements under ambient conditions. (e) Optical images of TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-2hydrogel under a cutting/healing cycle in a circuit with a light-emitting diode (LED) bulb.The electrical conductivity’s self-healing efficiency of composite hydrogels was further investigated.The conductivity of original, cutting, and self-healed TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-2 hydrogel wascharacterized by the I–V measurement in Figure 6b. After 10th, 20th, and 30th self-healing,the conductivity of TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-2 hydrogel was 12.8, 11.6, 10.0, and 8.0 S m−1, respectively.The self-healing efficiency was calculated by σr/σi (σr is the healing conductivity, and σi is theoriginal conductivity) [45]. After 10th, 20th, and 30th self-healing, the self-healing efficiency ofTOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-2 hydrogel was 90.6%, 78.1%, and 62.5%, respectively. The average efficiencywas 99.1% for each self-healing cycle, indicating the composite hydrogel possessed significant andrepeatable electrical restoration performance.By repeating the complete cutting/self-healing process, without any external force at roomtemperature, the conductivity of TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-2 hydrogel was tested through I-Vmeasurement. Figure 6c shows the time-current flow of TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-2 hydrogel atthe same location during repeated cutting/healing processes. In Figure 6d, when the hydrogel wascompletely cut in half to form an open circuit, the current dropped to zero. Then, the two fracturedparts contacted each other, and the current quickly recovered to the initial value through a 20 s in situself-healing. The conductivity of the hydrogel sample remained stable during the cycle, indicating thatthe conductivity had a high self-healing efficiency during the cutting-healing process.As shown in Figure 6e, the self-healing conductive performance of the composite hydrogel wasvisually displayed through a closed-loop composed of light-emitting diode (LED), TOCNF-CNT/PVA-2hydrogel, and power components. The LED indicator was lighted with a voltage of 5 V. The LEDindicator was extinguished when the TOCNF-CNT/PVA-2 hydrogel was completely separated.However, the LED indicator lit up again, after pushing the two separated parts together for self-healing,illustrating the excellent self-healing conductive property of the composite hydrogel. The hierarchical3D network consisting of PANI, CNTs, and TOCNFs formed a continuous conducting pathway forelectron transport. The dynamically reversible cross-linking points from different borate-inducedcomplexes provided inherent and repeatable self-healing capabilities for hydrogels, exhibiting promisefor the self-healing electrode materials [46].232Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 1123.7. Electrochemical Properties of Composite HydrogelsIn order to evaluate the effect of the incorporated PANI on the electrochemical behavior of thecomposite hydrogel electrode, a CV test was performed, as shown in Figure 7a. In the CV test, thepotential range was −0.2 to 0.8 V at a scan rate of 40 mV s−1, in 6 M KOH electrolyte with platinum sheetcounter electrode and Hg/HgO reference electrode. In Figure 7a, the CV curve of TOCNF-CNT/PVAexhibited regular rectangular and symmetric shapes, which reflected the typical characteristics of theelectric double layer charge (EDLC) storage. Moreover, the CV curves of composite hydrogel containingPANI possessed a larger current density and different shape. The increase in current density indicatedgreater capacitance, which was due to the pseudo-capacitance effect of PANI. The deformation of theCV curve was attributed to the diffusion and migration of limited ions in the polymer block and theohmic resistance due to the thick polymer layer [47]. However, the voltammograms of PANI-basedhydrogel possessed clear faradaic oxidation and reduction peaks. Three pairs characteristic peaksarose at 0, 0.4, and 0.6 V; the peaks arose at 0 and 0.6 V were related to the redox behavior of PANIthrough the leucoemeraldine and pernigraniline states; the peaks at 0.4 V were assigned to theelectron transition from the protonation/deprotonation of PANI [14,19]. Among these voltammograms,TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-2 possessed the largest loop area, corresponding to the highest specificcapacitance. Furthermore, the G-CD behaviors of these composite hydrogel electrodes were measuredat 0.4 A g−1 current density from −0.2 to 0.8 V with 6 M KOH electrolyte (Figure 7b). The G-CD curvesof the TOCNF-CNT/PVA hydrogel-based electrode exhibited a symmetrical triangle, indicating that itwas an electric double-layer capacitor with reversible capacitance characteristics. For all the samples,the G-CD profiles were nearly triangular, demonstrating their excellent capacitive performances. Basedon Equation (3), the Cs was calculated from the G-CD curves data. The Cs values of TOCNF-CNT/PVA,TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-1, TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-2, and TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-3 were 84.9,127.3, 226.8, and 184.4 F g−1 at 0.4 A g−1 current density, respectively. It was observed that compositehydrogel containing PANI possessed a higher specific capacitance than TOCNF-CNT/PVA hydrogel.The 3D network structure of TOCNF-CNT could load PANI and enable greater contact with electrolytes,thereby forming more active sites inside the hydrogel. Moreover, when CNTs were used as the fillerfor PANI to build a “core-shell” structure composite, the porous structure could further improve thecapacitance performance. The high specific capacitance originated from two different charge storagemethods: (1) the EDLC storage in CNTs nano-core and (2) the oxidation and reduction chemistry(pseudo-capacitance) of the PANI nano-shell [48].The specific capacitances of composite hydrogels remained approximately 80%. For all samples,the relationships between the specific capacitance and the current density are shown in Figure 7c.At the same current density, these composite hydrogels containing PANI possessed higher specificcapacitances than TOCNF-CNT/PVA hydrogels, indicating that PANI significantly increased thespecific capacitance of the composite hydrogel. The sp2-hybridized carbon atoms of CNTs formed π-πstacking interactions with the quinoid ring of the PANI without destroying the graphitized plane ofCNTs [49,50]. Among these hydrogels, the TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-2 possessed the largest specificcapacitance. It could be attributed to the appropriate ratio of PANI to CNTs, which allowed the PANIto better combine with the CNT networks. The developed pore structure and large specific surfacearea were beneficial to the charge accumulation and enhanced the specific capacitance.Nyquist plots from EIS of the composite hydrogel electrodes are shown in Figure 7d. The Nyquistplots of hydrogel electrodes showed a typical semicircle in the high-frequency region. The interceptof semicircle represented the equivalent series resistance (ESR), and the diameter of semicirclerepresented the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) of the interface. Correspondingly, the diameter of asemicircle of TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-2 hydrogel was the smallest in all samples, indicating thatTOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-2 hydrogel possessed the lowest resistance. It was because the cross-linked3D network structure in composite hydrogels provided an ideal charge-transfer path. Nyquist plotsshowed a straight line at the low-frequency region, and nearly vertical shape reflected the idealcapacitance characteristics [51,52].233Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 112Figure 7.

Self-Healable and Flexible Performance of the SupercapacitorThe self-healable and flexible solid-state supercapacitor was fabricated based onTOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-2 hydrogel electrode and TOCNF/PVA hydrogel electrolyte in a sandwichstructure. The detailed fabrication process was described in the experimental part. Due to theinherent flexibility and self-healing ability of the PVA hydrogel, the interfaces between hydrogelelectrode and electrolyte could be completely combined, thereby manufacturing an integrated solidsupercapacitor device. The assembled supercapacitor could withstand cutting, bending, and anothermechanical damage, but the electrochemical performance was not obviously affected. As demonstratedabove, the dynamically reversible PVA-borate cross-linking network provided the inherent, repeatable,and effective self-healable ability for the composite hydrogel (Figure 8a).Figure 8b,c shows the electrochemical performances of the self-healing supercapacitor aftermultiple cutting/healing cycles. The CV and G-CD curves of supercapacitor had no obvious deformationafter multiple cutting/healing cycles, indicating that the capacitance had not been significantly reduced.As calculated by the G-CD curves at 0.6 A g−1 current density, the initial specific capacitance of thesupercapacitor was 138 F g−1, and the specific capacitance after 1, 5, 10 cutting/healing cycles was137.3, 134.7, and 124.1 F g−1, respectively. The corresponding capacitance retention was 99.5%, 97.6%,and 90.0%, respectively. For the as-prepared supercapacitor device, the self-healing capability wasmore outstanding than those reports. For example, a CNT film was spread on a self-healable substrateto manufacture electrode, combining the self-healable electrodes and polyvinylpyrrolidone-sulfuricacid (PVP-H2SO4) gel electrolyte to fabricate a supercapacitor. Its capacitance retention reached 85.7%after the 5th cutting/healing cycles [53]. By coating PANI and CNT nanomaterials on the surface ofpolymer fibers with self-healing ability to develop a novel filamentous self-healable supercapacitor,its capacitance retention was 92% after one cutting/healing cycle [54]. In Figure 8c, the voltage drop234Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 112in the G-CD curves was due to the electron transfer resistance of the solid-state hydrogel-basedelectrolyte, which resulted in the specific capacitance of the supercapacitor being smaller than that ofthe electrode [3].Figure 8. (a) Schematic and structural illustration of the self-healing process due to the dynamic boratebond of the supercapacitor. (b) CV curves at initial and after the 1st, 5th, and 10th self-healing at a scanrate of 40 mV s−1. (c) G-CD curves at initial and after the 1st, 5th, and 10th self-healing at a currentdensity of 0.6 A g−1. (d) Self-healing efficiency derived from both G-CD and CV curves at self-healingcycles from 1st to 10th. (e) Capacitance retention over 1000 bending and twisting cycles at an angleof 180◦.The in-situ measurement method was used to evaluate the electrochemical performance of theassembled supercapacitor device under the bending or twisting state. Figure 8e shows the variation ofcapacitance according to the number of cycles, which were calculated from their G-CD curves at aconstant current density of 1 A g−1 after each bending cycle. A bending cycle started from flat-state,passed through a 180◦ bending-state, and then returned to flat-state. One twisting cycle was similar.In Figure 8e, the capacitance retention of the supercapacitor device was 85.0% and 82.3% after 1000bending cycles and twisting cycles, respectively. The performance was comparable supercapacitorto be tested in a flat state. Such a flexible solid-state supercapacitor with PANI hydrogel electrodepossessed capacitance retention of 86% after 1000 consecutive charge-discharge cycles [55]. It even wassuperior to the polyaniline-sodium alginate (PANI-SA) hydrogel supercapacitor reported previously(typically 71% retention for over 1000 cycles) [51]. The improved cycling stability could be due tothe quasi-solid hydrogel, further protecting the active PANI and avoiding the delamination of theCNT fibers as conductive pathways. The delamination from continuous expansion and shrinkage ofthe PANI molecular chain during the charge-discharge cycles could cause performance degradation.The superior capacitance retention under bending/twisting cycles also suggested that the contactbetween different layers of the supercapacitor device was excellent, which could benefit from theinherent self-healing property of PVA-based hydrogels [43]. The superior flexibility and self-healingsolid-state supercapacitor had promising potential applications in a flexible electronic device.4. ConclusionsA unique, flexible, and self-healing ECHs were synthesized through introducingTOCNF-CNT@PANI nanohybrid with a “core-shell” structure into viscoelastic PVA hydrogel matrix.The nanohybrid built a 3D hierarchical framework in the hydrogel matrix, which not only improved theviscoelasticity but also enhanced the electrochemical performance of the ECHs. The ECH possessed a235Nanomaterials 2020, 10, 112high mechanical toughness (σs ≈ 128 kPa cm3 g−1 and Ee ≈ 61 kPa), excellent viscoelastic characteristics(G′∞ ≈ 18.2 kPa and G”max ≈ 7.6 kPa), and ideal electroconductivity (up to 15.3 S m−1). The specificcapacitance of the TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-2 hydrogel electrode was 226.8 F g−1 at a current density of0.4 A g−1. The ECHs exhibited fast self-healing character within 20 s at room temperature and superiorflexile performance due to the reversible and dynamic borate-associated network. The symmetricsolid-state supercapacitor was fabricated by the TOCNF-CNT@PANI/PVA-2 hydrogel electrodesand TOCNF/PVA electrolyte; the capacitance retention was 90% after 10 cutting/healing cycles;the capacitance retention was 85.0% and 82.3% after 1000 bending and twisting cycles, respectively.Consequently, the novel ECHs provided an alternative platform for personal wearable electronic devices.Author Contributions: Conceptualization, J.H. and X.X.; methodology, J.H. and X.X.; validation, Y.L., Y.Y.,J.H. and X.X.; formal analysis, J.H. and X.X.; investigation, Q.W.; resources, J.H. and X.X.; writing—originaldraft preparation, H.W. and S.K.B. and S.Z.; writing—review and editing, Y.L., Y.Y., J.H., X.X., Q.W. and H.X.;supervision, J.H. and X.X.
