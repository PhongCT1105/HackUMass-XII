This study aimed \nto examine knowledge about latex allergy among \nnurses and compare their performance with \nstudent nurses in Thailand. A knowledge ques-\ntionnaire was administered to a random sample \nof 30 nurses and 30 student nurses who worked \nin hospitals where powdered latex gloves were \nused. Overall, nurses and student nurses gave \ncorrect responses to 27% and 28% of the ques-\ntions, respectively. There was no statistically \nsignificant difference in knowledge between \nnurses and student nurses. Both nurses and \nstudent nurses in Thailand have insufficient \nknowledge about latex allergy and its risk fac-\ntors. Additional continuing education should be \nprovided to reduce the probability of adverse \nreactions in sensitized staff and patients in Thai \nhospitals. \nKeywords: Latex Allergy; Education; Nurses;  \nStudent Nurses; Hospitals \n1. INTRODUCTION \nNatural rubber latex (NRL) can cause allergic symp-\ntoms in health care workers who use products containing \nthese allergens in their daily work and it has been shown \nthat the incidence of latex allergy in health care workers \ncan usually be associated with exposure to latex aller-\ngens encountered at the workplace [1]. The prevalence \nof latex allergy in health care workers ranges from 2% to \n18% [2,3], whilst in the general population, the preva-\nlence of latex allergy ranges between 0.4% - 2.3% [4].  \nExposure to natural rubber latex can result not only in \nskin problems such as irritant, allergic contact dermatitis, \nangioedema, and itchy skin [2,5], but also respiratory \nproblems such as rhinitis, sneezing, wheezing [3,6]. \nFurthermore, it can also cause serious adverse health \neffects such as asthma and anaphylaxis [7]. Whilst the \nreplacement of latex gloves with non-latex or non- \npowder gloves has been shown to reduce the incidence \nof latex allergy [8], such measures may not be suitable in \nsome developing countries due to their cost. For exam-\nple, in Thailand, powdered latex gloves are still widely \nused [9]. In such situations, it has been argued that con-\ntinuing education about latex allergy is essential to sup-\nport the effectiveness of latex allergy prevention and \ncontrol policies in hospitals [10]. Health effects of latex \nallergy can occur not only in health care workers but \nalso in sensitised patients for whom they take care [11]. \nThus providing latex allergy education is of importance \nnot only for health care workers themselves but also for \nthe health of their patients. To the best of our knowledge \nno study has yet reported on the levels of knowledge \nabout latex allergy among health care workers in Thai-\nland. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use \nof a dedicated latex-knowledge questionnaire in health \ncare workers in Thailand and subsequently to provide an \nindication about the level of knowledge about latex al-\nlergy-related issues among Thai nurses and student \nnurses. \n2. METHODS \nIn this cross-sectional study, 30 nurses were randomly \nselected from 11 community hospitals and 30 3rd-year \nstudent nurses from a University in Thailand were also \nrandomly invited to participate. The study was collected \nin June - July 2008. All enrolled nurses were currently \n*Funding: This work is part of a PhD project sponsored by the Royal \nThai Government. \nCompeting Interests: None \nEthical approval for this study was obtained from the University of \nManchester’s Committee on the Ethics of Research on Human Beings \n(ref TPCS/ethics/08117). \n \nC.

All \nparticipants were asked to complete a questionnaire that \nevaluated their knowledge on latex allergy. \nThis questionnaire was developed specifically for this \nstudy and was divided in four distinct domains: 1) pre-\nvention of latex allergy, 2) potential adverse effects on \nhealth, 3) potential risk factors for latex allergy and 4) \ndiagnosis of latex allergy. Questions were derived by the \nauthors based on literature reviews [5,12] and on the \nlatex allergy guidelines from the National Institute for \nOccupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and Health \nand Safety Executive (HSE) [13,14]. The questionnaire \nwas designed so that positive and negative statements \nwere randomly distributed in all four domains. The final \nversion was peer reviewed by experts in the field of im-\nmunology and epidemiology. Subsequently, it was \ntranslated from English to Thai and back-translated from \nThai into English by a second bilingual researcher to \ncheck for consistency and clarity of translation. Re-\nspondents were required to reply to each question on a \nfive-point Likert scale ranging from “strongly disagree” \nto “strongly agree” [15]. Five-point Likert scale answers \nwere then scored between +2 to –2 depending on \nwhether the answer was correct or incorrect, respectively \n(either strongly agree (+2), agree (+1) or disagree (–1) or \nstrongly disagree (–2), depending on the question), with \nthe response of ‘uncertain’ scored as zero score. Scores \nfrom each nurse or student nurse were subsequently \nadded up per question as well as per domain to compare \ngroup-differences in knowledge between nurses and \nstudent nurses. This implies that a participant who gave \nthe correct answer to all questions (answering strongly \nagree/disagree) would have a score of 50, while some-\none who was incorrect at all questions (answering \nstrongly agree/disagree) would have –50. A Cronbach’s \nalpha (reliability) of 0.755 was found indicating internal \nconsistency in this knowledge questionnaire instrument. \nStatistical analyses were conducted using SPSS 15.0 \nsoftware for window (SPSS Inc.UK). Descriptive data \nanalysis was used to assess the distribution of variables. \nIndependent t-tests were used to compare the difference \nof knowledge scores between nurses and student nurses. \nA p-value of 5% was considered to indicate statistical \nsignificance. Bonferroni corrections were used to ac-\ncount for issues of multiple-comparisons [16]. \n3. RESULTS \n56 of 60 respondents completed and returned the \nquestionnaires giving a response rate of 93%. There was \nno difference in the response rate between nurses and \nstudent nurses. The general characteristics of the re-\nspondents are described in Table 1. About 91% of re-\nspondents were female, which is comparable to the Thai \nnursing population [17]. The age of respondents ranged \nfrom 20 to 50 years with a mean age (SD) of 27.2 (7.8) \nyears. Students were on average 7 years younger than \nnurses (27 vs. 34, respectively). 24 of 28 nurses (86%) \ngraduated with a bachelor degree in nursing, with the \nremaining 4 (14%) graduating with a diploma in nursing. \nOn average, nurses had been working as nurses for 6 \nyears, ranging from 3 months to 26 years. 90.4% of re-\nspondents wore powdered latex gloves in their work \nshifts (80% and 100% for nurses and students, respec-\ntively), using on average 5.5 (SD = 3.7) pairs per day.  \nGroup knowledge scores were normally distributed. \nThe mean knowledge assessment scores of all respon-\ndents was –0.04 (SD = 0.16) (Table 2). A comparison of \nmean scores between both groups of nurses and student \nnurses showed that there were no significant difference \nin latex allergy knowledge (p = 0.71). None of the mean \nknowledge scores for domains D1 to D4 differed sig-\nnificantly from zero, and were –0.09, –0.05, 0.20, and \n–0.65 for domains D1 to D4, respectively. The partici-\npants knew the least about issues related to the diagnosis \nof latex allergy (D4) with only 1.8% and 5.4% of ques-\ntions answered correctly by the nurses and student \nnurses (Table 3), respectively. The highest number of \ncorrect answers was found for questions addressing po-\ntential risk factors for latex allergy (D3) (34.5% in \nnurses and 37% in student nurses, respectively). \nNo Statistically significant differences were found \nbetween nurses and student nurses in any of the do-\nmains.  \nOverall, 28% of answers were correcting answer, but \nthe majority of questions (41%) were answered as “Do \nnot know” (Table 3). Over 50% of all respondents gave \na correct answer on “Screening can assist to identify \nlatex allergy” (question 1), “Atopic individual have risk \nto develop latex allergy” (question 9), and “Instruments \nsuch as syringes, air ways, endotracheal tubes and oxy-\ngen tubing contain latex allergens” (question 24).  \nHowever, knowledge was low, with less than 25% of \nrespondents giving a correct answer, on the following \nquestions; \nQ3. The room must be clean and the air allowed to \nsettle for at least 6 hours before latex allergy patients are \nadmitted. \nQ11. Skin irritation to latex gloves is a result from an \nimmune response. \nQ13. Latex allergy can be diagnosed by clinical symp-\ntoms only. \nQ14.

Chemicals in latex gloves can induce respiratory \nsymptoms in health care workers.  \nA comparison of the proportion of correct answers for \neach question between nurses and student nurses sug-\ngested statistically significant differences for questions 1 \nand 19 (p < 0.05). As a group, student nurses seemed to \nbetter than nurses in identifying that screening can assist \nin identification of latex allergic patients (question 1) (p \n< 0.01), while more nurses gave a correct answer re-\ngarding adverse symptoms to latex allergens (question \n19) (p < 0.05). However, adjusting for multiple com-\nparisons none of these remained statistically significant. \n \nTable 1.

Most \nnotably, none of the participants knew that nitrile gloves \nand vinyl gloves do not contain latex allergens (question \n21). Also, none of the students (and only 7% of nurses) \nwere familiar with “hypoallergenic gloves” (question 5), \nwhile all nurses (and only 11% of students) thought that \nlatex allergy could be diagnosed based on clinical \nsymptoms only (question 13). \nIn addition, these analyses further suggest that several \nquestions (questions 6, 7, 8, 18, 21) were very difficult \nfor nurses or student nurses to answer with the majority \n(> 50%) of the nurses and student nurses answering \n“Don’t know” to these questions. Overall, the results in \nthis study suggest that 62% of study population (33% of \nrespondents giving wrong answers and 39% of respon-\ndents giving “do not know” answers) had insufficient \nknowledge about latex allergy. \n4. DISCUSSION \nResults from this study suggest that both nurses and \nstudent nurses had insufficient knowledge about latex \nallergy and that no statistically significant differences \nwere observed between knowledge levels of nurses and \nstudent nurses. This finding is similar to that found in \nother countries [18-20]. Nurses who were allergic to \nlatex on average have been shown to have less knowl-\nedge about latex allergy knowledge than nurses who \nwere not allergic [18]. This association might also be \npresented in this study, but allergic status was not deter-\nmined in this study. However, it is possible that inade-\nquate knowledge about latex allergy and risk factors may \nlead to the development of serious adverse symptoms in \nsensitized nurse, a suggestion made previously [18]. \nAlthough most of the students in this population (75%) \nknew that instruments such as syringes, air ways, en-\ndotracheal tubes and oxygen tubing contain latex aller-\ngens, surprisingly, only 21% knew that the use of pow-\nder free gloves can reduce latex allergy in health care \nworkers, while none of the nurses or students knew that \nnitrile gloves and vinyl gloves did not contain any latex \nproteins at all. Opposite results were found in a study in \nTurkey [20] which showed that whereas all Turkish \nmedical students knew that gloves may contain latex \nallergens, as many as 82% were not aware that medical \ninstruments such as catheters, surgical materials, intra-\nvenous lines, and syringes could also contain latex al-\nlergens. We speculate that these differences are either \ncaused by differences in education in both countries or \nby methodological differences in the way the questions \nwere asked, although which of these hypotheses is valid \ncannot be proven.  \nAlso, although over 80% of students in our study \nknew that NRL can cause allergy, less than 8% were \nfamiliar with the fact that the NRL can cause both im-\nmediate hypersensitivity (type I) and delayed hypersen-\nsitivity (type IV). This is comparable to the data from \nTurkey, where 84.8% of medical students knew that \navoidance of exposure to NRL products is a protection \nmethod and 15.8% knew that wearing vinyl gloves be-\nfore wearing latex gloves can prevent the direct contact \nwith latex proteins [20]. \nThis study provides data specifically for the health \ncare industry in Thailand and, in agreement with data \nfrom other countries discussed above, suggests that ad-\nditional and continuing training should be provided to \nstudent nurses as well as to nurses to reduce the risk of \nC.

This is in agreement with recom-\nmendations from NIOSH who recommended that work-\ners should receive education programs and training ma-\nterials about latex allergy [13]. Furthermore, HSE also \nrecommended that employers and healthcare providers \nshould be education on NRL allergy and risk factors [14]. \nA study in Sweden reported an improvement in knowl-\nedge about latex allergy-related topics in nurses who \nreceived a special training program, although after this \none-off program the score remained inadequate provid-\ning additional argumentation for continuing education \n[19]. \nIt has been suggested that additional training should \nbe focussed on three groups. Firstly, sensitised individu-\nals should be educated on conditions and latex allergy \navoidance and prevention. Secondly, workers, particu-\nlarly health care workers, who are at risk of latex allergy, \nshould be educated about latex allergy and prevention of \nlatex allergy as well as about latex-free alternative in-\nstruments. Finally, latex allergy education, particularly \nlatex allergy prevention policies and latex safety in \nworkplaces for latex sensitised individuals, should be \nprovided to employers [21]. \n5. CONCLUSIONS \nIn conclusion, the finding of this study indicate that \nnurses working in community-based hospitals in Thai-\nland as well as Thai student nurses have a similar educa-\ntion level regarding latex allergy in the workplace and its \nrisk factors, and that this level at present is insufficient \nin both groups. Additional latex allergy education and \ntraining should be provided to student nurses during \ntheir degrees and this should be continued during their \nprofessional lives. Education training programs should \nnot be limited to general information about latex allergy \nbut should also focus on reducing latex allergens in the \nworkplace environment. \n6.
