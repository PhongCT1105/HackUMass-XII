In this assessment, only 8 percent of Americans have knowledge equivalent \nto an A or B, 40 percent would receive a C or D, and 52 percent would get an F. The study also \nfound important gaps in knowledge and common misconceptions about climate change and the \nearth system. These misconceptions lead some people to doubt that global warming is happening or \nthat human activities are a major contributor, to misunderstand the causes and therefore the \nsolutions, and to be unaware of the risks. Thus many Americans lack some of the knowledge needed \nfor informed decision-making in a democratic society. For example, only: \n \n• 57% know that the greenhouse effect refers to gases in the atmosphere that trap heat; \n• 50% of Americans understand that global warming is caused mostly by human activities; \n• 45% understand that carbon dioxide traps heat from the Earth’s surface;  \n• 25% have ever heard of coral bleaching or ocean acidification. \n \nMeanwhile, large majorities incorrectly think that the hole in the ozone layer and aerosol spray cans \ncontribute to global warming, leading many to incorrectly conclude that banning aerosol spray cans \nor stopping rockets from punching holes in the ozone layer are viable solutions.  \n \nHowever, many Americans do understand that emissions from cars and trucks and the burning of \nfossil fuels contribute to global warming, and that a transition to renewable energy sources is an \nimportant solution. \n \nIn addition, despite the recent controversies over “climategate” and the 2007 IPCC report, this study \nfinds that Americans trust scientists and scientific organizations far more than any other source of \ninformation about global warming.  \n \nAmericans also recognize their own limited understanding of the issue. Only 1 in 10 say that they are \n“very well informed” about climate change, and 75 percent say they would like to know more. \nLikewise, 75 percent say that schools should teach our children about climate change and 68 percent \nwould welcome a national program to teach Americans about the issue. \n \n        \n \nYale University Americans’ Knowledge of Climate Change 4 \nIntroduction \n \n \n \nKnowledge about climate change can be divided into several general and overlapping categories: \nknowledge about how the climate system works; specific knowledge about the causes, consequences, \nand potential solutions to global warming; contextual knowledge placing human-caused global \nwarming in historical and geographic perspective; and practical knowledge that enables individual \nand collective action. This study included measures related to each of these key dimensions, along \nwith other measures such as public desire for more information, trust in different information \nsources, and climate change risk perceptions, policy preferences, and behaviors. \n \nMethodology \n \nThese results come from a nationally representative survey of American adults, aged 18 and older. \nThe sample was weighted to correspond with US Census Bureau demographic and Gallup political \nparty identification parameters for the United States. The surveys were conducted by Knowledge \nNetworks, using an online research panel of American adults. The survey was conducted June 24 \nthrough July 22, 2010 with 2,030 American adults. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 2 \npercent, with 95 percent confidence. Question order and wording can also introduce error into the \nresults of surveys. \n \nFor analysis, some items were re-coded as a 1 (a correct answer) or 0 (an incorrect answer, including \ndon’t know & refused). For example, several questions asked respondents whether a statement was \n“definitely true”, “probably true”, “probably false”, or “definitely false”. These responses were \nconverted into a simple true vs. false dichotomous measure. Likewise, questions that provided the \nresponse options “a lot”, “some”, “a little”, “not at all” or “don’t know” were also converted into \nsimple dichotomous variables for analysis.  \n \nIn some cases, there is a clear “correct” or “incorrect” answer, strongly supported or strongly \nrejected by well-established scientific evidence. In other cases, there is a “best” answer reflecting \nbroadly held scientific agreement, but somewhat more subjective. We provide references to peer-\nreviewed, scientific sources for each answer (see the Appendix: Answer Key). Best or correct \nanswers are indicated with a (√). Unknown or uncertain answers are indicated with a (*). All results \nshow percentages among all respondents, unless otherwise labeled. Totals may occasionally sum to \nmore than 100 percent due to rounding. The term “order of items randomized” refers to a standard \nsurvey technique in which questions and/or response categories are presented to respondents in a \nrandom order. This technique helps to prevent “order bias” in respondent answers.  \n \nGrading the Public \n \nAs a first-brush estimate of overall public knowledge about climate change, a straight grading scale \nwas constructed, using only those items for which there was a correct or best answer. To adjust for \nthe difficulty of some items, only questions that were answered correctly by at least 25 percent of the \nrespondents were included in the grade calculation (although all results are reported below in the \nresults section). Thus this “grade” is based on a total of 81 individual questions. Each respondent \nwas given a percentage score based on their total number of correct answers. Graded on a straight \n        \n \nYale University Americans’ Knowledge of Climate Change 5 \nscale (scores 90% and above = A, 80-89% = B, 70-79% = C, 60-69 = D, and scores 59% and below \n= F), 1 percent of the public received an A, 7 percent a B, 15 percent a C, 25 percent a D, and 52 \npercent an F, indicating that relatively few Americans have an in-depth understanding of climate \nchange.  \n \nThis “grade”, however, should be interpreted with caution. Some questions clearly were harder to \nanswer than others. Likewise, other researchers might have chosen to assess different types of \nclimate-related knowledge, which perhaps the public better understands. It is also important to \nrecognize that very few Americans have ever taken a formal course on climate change, so it is \nperhaps unsurprising that they lack detailed knowledge about the issue. Instead, these results likely \nreflect the unorganized and sometimes contradictory fragments of information Americans have \nabsorbed from the mass media and other sources. Further, many of these questions are outside the \neveryday practical needs of most people. Most people don’t need to know about climate change in \ntheir daily life, thus it is not surprising that they have devoted little effort to learning these details. \n \nNonetheless, many of these questions reveal important gaps in knowledge and common \nmisconceptions about climate change and the earth system. These misconceptions lead some people \nto doubt that climate change is happening or that human activities are a major contributor, to \nmisunderstand the causes and therefore the solutions, and to be unaware of the risks. Thus many \nAmericans lack some of the knowledge needed for informed decision-making about this issue in a \ndemocratic society. \n \n \nGrading Public Knowledge of  Climate Change\n1\n7\n15\n25\n52\n0\n75\nA B C D F\nStraight Scale\nP\ner\nce\nnt\n o\nf \nR\nes\npo\nnd\nen\nts\n        \n \nYale University Americans’ Knowledge of Climate Change 6 \nTo further adjust for the difficulty of some questions, we constructed a curved grading scale as an \nalternative scoring system. First, the mean percentage score was calculated (54%). Scores +/- 0.5 \nstandard deviations from the mean (44% to 65%) were assigned the letter grade C. Scores ranging \nfrom +/- 0.5 to 1.5 standard deviations from the mean were assigned the letter grades B (66% to \n86%) and D (23% to 43%) respectively. Finally, scores ranging from +/- 1.5 to 2.5 standard \ndeviations from the mean were assigned the letter grades A (87% or higher) and F (22% or less) \nrespectively. \n \nThis grading system thus enables us to see that although overall public knowledge of climate change \nis low, there is significant variation within these scores, with a third of Americans scoring an A or B \non this curved scale, over a third scoring a C, and over a quarter scoring a D or F. This grading \nsystem will be particularly useful for subsequent analyses comparing the relative levels of knowledge \nacross different groups within American society. \n \nGrading Public Knowledge of  Climate Change\n2\n31\n40\n16\n11\n0\n50\nA B C D F\nCurved Scale\nP\ner\nce\nnt\n o\nf \nR\nes\npo\nnd\nen\nts\n        \n \nYale University Americans’ Knowledge of Climate Change 7 \nSummary Results \n \n \nSelf-reported Knowledge \n \n• Relatively few Americans (11 to 14%) say they are “very well informed” about how the \nclimate system works or the different causes, consequences, or potential solutions to global \nwarming, while 51 to 52 percent say they are “fairly well informed.” \n \nClimate Change Beliefs and Worry \n \n• A majority (63%) of Americans understand that global warming is happening, while 19 \npercent say it is not happening, and 19 percent say they don’t know. \n• Half of Americans (50%) say that if global warming is happening, it is caused mostly by \nhuman activities. Over a third (35%) say that if it is happening, it is caused by natural \nchanges, while 7 percent reject the question and say global warming is not happening. \n• Thirty-nine percent (39%) say that most scientists think global warming is happening, while \n38 percent say there is a lot of disagreement among scientists whether or not global warming \nis happening. \n• Just over half of Americans say they are very (16%) or somewhat worried (39%) about global \nwarming, while 45 percent say they are not very (26%), or not at all worried (19%). \n \nUnderstanding of the “Greenhouse Effect” \n \n• A large majority of Americans (87%) have heard of the “greenhouse effect”, but 13 percent \nhave not. \n• Of those that have heard of the greenhouse effect, however, 66 percent correctly understand \nthat it refers to “gases in the atmosphere that trap heat.” Twenty-one percent incorrectly \nbelieve it refers to the Earth’s protective ozone layer, while another 10 percent say they don’t \nknow. Thus nationally, 57 percent of American adults have both heard of and correctly \nunderstand what the greenhouse effect is. \n• Majorities of Americans correctly understand that greenhouse gases, changes in the Earth’s \norbit around the sun, volcanic eruptions, the amount of dust in the atmosphere, sunspots, \nclouds, and whether the Earth’s surface is light or dark colored (albedo) can affect the \naverage temperature of the Earth. Many incorrectly believe, however, that earthquakes and \nthe phases of the moon also affect the Earth’s temperature. Finally, 16 to 33 percent of \nAmericans say they don’t know whether any of the above can affect the average global \ntemperature of the Earth. \n• A plurality (45%) of Americans understand that carbon dioxide is good at trapping heat \nfrom the Earth’s surface. Relatively few, however, understand that methane (25%) or water \nvapor (12%) are important heat-trapping gases as well.  \n \nWeather vs. Climate \n \n• Majorities of American adults correctly understand that weather often changes from year to \nyear (83%) and that “climate” means the average weather conditions in a region (74%). \nMajorities, however, incorrectly believe that the climate often changes from year to year or \n        \n \nYale University Americans’ Knowledge of Climate Change 8 \nthat “weather” means the average climate conditions in a region, suggesting that many \npeople continue to confuse weather and climate.  \n \nThe Flow of Heat Across the Planet \n \n• A slight majority (54%) understands that ocean currents carry heat from the equator toward \nthe poles, but 34 percent say they don’t know whether this is true or false. Fewer Americans \n(33%) correctly understand that the atmosphere does not carry heat from the poles (which \nare cold) towards the equator (which is warm), while 40 percent say they don’t know. \n \nClimate Change: Past and Present \n \n• A majority of Americans (73%) correctly understands that current conditions are not colder \nthan ever before in Earth’s history, but a majority (55%) incorrectly believes the opposite – \nthat the Earth’s climate is now warmer than it has ever been before (this is false – global \ntemperatures have been warmer than current conditions many times in the past).  \n• A majority of Americans (67%) correctly understands that the Earth’s climate has not been \nthe same for millions of years, but a large majority (67%) incorrectly believes that the Earth’s \nclimate has always shifted gradually between warm and cold periods. \n• Fewer than half of Americans (41%) understand that the last 10,000 years have been \nunusually warm and stable, compared to the climate of the past million years. \n• While a majority (57%) understands that rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere \nhave caused global temperatures to increase in the past, relatively few (24%) understand that \nthe converse is also true – that rising temperatures have caused levels of carbon dioxide in \nthe atmosphere to increase as well. (Global temperatures and carbon dioxide levels can \ninfluence each other through positive or negative feedbacks.) \n• A majority (63%) believes that climate changes have played an important role in the advance \nor collapse of some past human civilizations. \n \nTemperature Estimates \n \n• Respondents were given the current temperature of the Earth’s surface (approximately 58º \nFahrenheit) as a reference point. They were then asked what they thought the average \ntemperature was during the last ice age. The correct answer is between 46º and 51º. The \nmedian public response, however, was 32º – the freezing point of water – while many other \npeople responded 0º. \n• Americans, however, did much better estimating the Earth’s surface temperature 150 years \nago (before the Industrial Revolution). The correct answer is approximately 56º to 57º \nFahrenheit. The median public response was 54º. \n• When asked what temperature they thought it would be by the year 2020 if no additional \nactions are taken to reduce global warming, the median response was 60º, slightly higher \nthan the scientific estimate of 58.4º Fahrenheit. \n• Likewise, when asked what temperature they thought it would be by the year 2050, the \nmedian response was 62º, slightly higher than the scientific estimate of 60 to 61º Fahrenheit. \n \n \n \n \n        \n \nYale University Americans’ Knowledge of Climate Change 9 \nConceptual Models of Climate Change \n \n• Americans have very different mental models of the stability of the climate system. \nRespondents were shown a series of simple pictures and text describing 5 different models \nof climate stability and asked which one best represented their understanding of how the \nclimate system works. A third (34%) selected a “threshold” or “tipping point” model \ndescribing a stable climate, but stable only within certain limits. In this model, a small \namount of global warming will have little to no effect, but a large amount of warming will \ncross critical thresholds and have dangerous effects. By contrast, nearly a quarter (24%) \nselected a “gradual” model describing a climate slow to change, in which global warming will \ngradually lead to dangerous effects. Next, 21 percent of Americans selected a “random” \nmodel describing a completely unpredictable climate system, in which we do not know what \nwill happen. Finally, relatively few chose a “fragile” model describing a delicately balanced \nclimate, in which a small amount of global warming will have abrupt and catastrophic effects \n(11%) or a “stable” model, describing a very stable climate system that will be unaffected by \nglobal warming (10%). At different time or spatial scales the climate system can exhibit each \nof these behaviors, but the best overall answer is the threshold model.  \n \nFossil Fuels \n \n• Most Americans correctly understand that coal (80%) and oil (76%) are fossil fuels. They are \na little more confused, however, about natural gas – 60 percent correctly identify it as a fossil \nfuel, but 17 percent say it is not, while an additional 23 percent say they don’t know. Most \nAmericans also correctly understand that solar energy and hydrogen are not fossil fuels, but \n28 percent incorrectly believe that wood is a fossil fuel. \n• Americans have a limited understanding of where the energy in fossil fuels originally came \nfrom. Just over half (52%) correctly understand that the energy in fossil fuels comes from \nphotosynthesis by plants over millions of years, while 29 percent correctly understand that \nthe sun was the ultimate source of energy in these fuels. Nearly half (47%) incorrectly say \nthat fossil fuels are the fossilized remains of dinosaurs. Twenty percent of Americans say \nfossil fuels come from uranium in the Earth.  Finally, substantial numbers (25-36%) say they \ndo not know whether each of these answers are true or false.  \n \nCarbon Dioxide \n \n• A large majority of Americans (67%) correctly identifies carbon dioxide as a gas produced by \nthe burning of fossil fuels. \n• Over three-quarters of Americans (76-78%) say they simply don’t know how much carbon \ndioxide was in the atmosphere in 1850 or today. Very few (6-7%) correctly understand that \nthere were roughly 290 parts per million of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere in 1850, \ncompared to 390 parts per million today. \n• When presented with five simple graphs describing different trajectories of the amount of \ncarbon dioxide in the atmosphere over the past 500 years, 40 percent of the public correctly \nselects the graph depicting exponential growth. Another 41 percent select the graph \ndepicting a linear rise, while fewer than 10 percent choose each of the other three graphs \ndepicting no change in the amount of carbon dioxide, a linear decrease, or an exponential \ndecrease. \n        \n \nYale University Americans’ Knowledge of Climate Change 10 \n• A majority of Americans (62%) correctly understands that even if human beings were to \nstop burning fossil fuels today, global warming would not immediately stop, however, 57 \npercent incorrectly believe that the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would \ndecrease almost immediately or don’t know.  \n• Likewise, few Americans (19%) correctly understand that on average carbon dioxide stays in \nthe atmosphere hundreds to thousands of years once it has been emitted. \n• Americans are equally likely to believe that either China (36%) or the United States (34%) is \nthe world’s largest emitter of carbon dioxide. China recently supplanted the United States as \nthe world’s largest emitter. \n• A plurality (42%) of Americans correctly understands that the United States emits the most \ncarbon dioxide per person. However, nearly a third (31%) say they don’t know, while 18 \npercent incorrectly say China. \n \nCauses of Global Warming \n \n• Majorities of Americans correctly understand that cars and trucks, burning fossil fuels for \nheat and electricity, deforestation, and cows contribute to global warming. \n• Majorities of Americans, however, incorrectly believe that the hole in the ozone layer, toxic \nwastes, aerosol spray cans, volcanic eruptions, the sun, and acid rain contribute to global \nwarming. \n• A majority believes that nuclear power plants also contribute to global warming. Nuclear \npower plants do not emit greenhouse gases when they generate energy, although there are \nemissions associated with plant construction, operation, decommissioning, and the mining \nand milling of uranium. \n• Almost half of Americans (49%) incorrectly believe that the space program contributes to \nglobal warming. \n \nClimate Skeptic Arguments \n \n• Many Americans incorrectly believe that since scientists can’t predict the weather more than \na few days in advance, they can’t possibly predict the climate of the future (42%) or that \ncomputer models are too unreliable to predict the climate of the future (37%). \n• A third of Americans (35%) incorrectly believe that in the 1970s, most scientists were \npredicting an ice age. \n• A third of Americans (33%) also incorrectly believe that since the Earth’s climate has \nchanged naturally in the past, humans are not the cause of global warming today. \n• Relatively few (19%) incorrectly believe that any recent global warming is caused by the sun, \nthat the record snowstorms last winter in the eastern U.S. prove that global warming is not \nhappening (18%), or that the Earth is actually cooling, not warming (15%). \n• Only 12 percent of Americans say that global warming is happening, but will be more \nbeneficial than harmful. \n• All of these items, however, include from 19 to 47 percent of Americans who say they don’t \nknow whether these statements are true or false. \n \nImpacts \n \n• A large majority (68%) of Americans correctly understands that global warming will cause \nsome places to get wetter, while others will get drier. \n        \n \nYale University Americans’ Knowledge of Climate Change 11 \n• Likewise 58 percent correctly understands that global warming will increase crop yields in \nsome places, and decrease it in others. \n• Half of the public (51%) correctly understands that the decade from 2000 to 2009 was \nwarmer than any other decade since 1850. \n• More than half (59%) of Americans incorrectly believe that global warming will cause \ntemperatures to increase by roughly the same amount in all countries, or say they don’t know \n(some regions of the Earth will warm much more than others). \n• Twenty-one percent of Americans correctly understand that most of the glaciers on Earth \nare melting. By contrast, 11 percent say all of them are melting, 48 percent say only some of \nthem are, and 4 percent say none of them are melting. \n• Of those who said that all, most, or some of the Earth’s glaciers are melting, the large \nmajority (84%) correctly understands that the speed of melting has increased over the past \n100 years. \n• Large majorities correctly understand that the melting of land ice in Antarctica (76%), \nmountain glaciers (73%), and warmer ocean temperatures (60%) are causes of global sea \nlevel rise. \n• A large majority (76%) also says that the melting of sea ice on the Arctic Ocean is a cause of \nsea level rise. For many years, it was assumed that sea ice melting would not contribute to \nsea level rise, as the ice already displaced an equal amount of water (which is why your glass \nof ice water does not overflow when the ice cubes melt). This assumption, however, has \nbeen challenged by recent research that finds a small, but significant contribution to global \nsea levels from Arctic sea ice as well, due to the difference in density and temperature \nbetween sea ice (fresh water) and the ocean below (salt water) (see Appendix). \n• Most Americans, however, probably do not understand the above nuance, as evident in their \nresponse to the next question, which asked which of the listed causes has contributed the \nmost to sea level rise so far. Arctic sea ice is the most commonly selected answer (34%), with \nAntarctic land ice second at 24 percent. The correct answer, however, is thermal expansion \nby the warming oceans (22%). \n• Majorities of Americans say they simply do not know how much global sea levels rose from \n1900 to 2000 (57%) or how much they may rise by 2100 (48%), if no additional actions are \ntaken to reduce global warming. \n• Large majorities of Americans have read or heard nothing about either coral bleaching (75%) \nor ocean acidification (77%). \n• Of those Americans who have heard of these two climate-change related issues, 54 percent \ncorrectly understand that warmer ocean temperatures cause coral bleaching, while 32 percent \ncorrectly understand that absorption of carbon dioxide by the ocean causes ocean \nacidification. \n \nSolutions \n \n• Large majorities of Americans correctly understand that the following actions would reduce \nglobal warming if they were done worldwide: switching from fossil fuels to renewable energy \nsources (75%), planting trees (81%), reducing tropical deforestation (73%); switching from \ngasoline to electric cars (75%), driving less (76%), increasing public transportation (67%), \nswitching from regular incandescent to compact fluorescent bulbs (69%), insulating \nbuildings, (65%), and switching from fossil fuels to nuclear power (59%). \n• Large majorities of Americans, however, incorrectly believe that reducing toxic waste (67%) \nor banning aerosol spray cans (69%) would reduce global warming. An additional 43 percent \n        \n \nYale University Americans’ Knowledge of Climate Change 12 \nincorrectly believe that if we stopped punching holes in the ozone layer with rockets, it \nwould reduce global warming. \n• Majorities do not believe or don’t know if placing a large tax on all fossil fuels (53%), having \nat most 2 children per family (60%), or stopping the eating of beef (69%) would reduce \nglobal warming.  \n• Finally, large majorities of Americans do not believe that proposed geo-engineering solutions \n– like fertilizing the ocean to make algae grow faster (64%) or using airplanes to scatter dust \nhigh in the atmosphere (81%) – will reduce global warming, including more than 4 out 10 \nwho say they simply don’t know. \n• When asked which one action would do the most to reduce global warming, switching from \nfossil fuels to renewable energy sources was the action most selected (36%). \n \nInformation Sources \n \n• Americans’ most trusted sources of information about global warming are the National \nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) (78%), the National Science Foundation \n(74%), scientists (72%), science programs on television (72%), natural history museums \n(73%), and science museums (72%). \n• Roughly a quarter of Americans have visited a science, technology, or natural history \nmuseum in the past 12 months, while more have visited a nature center (37%) or zoo or \naquarium (43%). \n• Relatively few Americans (8%) have ever attended a global warming lecture or event with \nhands-on activities, while 14 percent have seen an exhibit on global warming at a science \ncenter or museum. \n• Americans say they have learned the most about global warming from television (88%), \nnewspapers (71%), family and friends (69%), books or magazines (68%), and the internet \n(65%). \n• Nearly 4 out of 10 Americans (39%) say they follow news about the environment very (7%) \nor somewhat closely (32%), while 71 percent say they follow the local weather forecast very \n(32%) or somewhat closely (39%). \n• Americans say they have thought about global warming a lot (17%), some (35%), a little \n(33%), or not at all (15%). \n• Just over a quarter (27%) say that the issue of global warming is either extremely (7%) or \nvery important to them personally (20%). \n• A large majority, however, says that they need a lot more (25%), some more (26%), or a little \nmore information (25%) about global warming before making up their mind about the issue. \n• Americans say that the internet (38%) is the first place they would go to get more \ninformation about global warming, followed by television (16%), and government websites \n(12%). \n• Finally, large majorities of Americans say that schools should teach our children about the \ncauses, consequences, and potential solutions to global warming (75%) and that the \ngovernment should establish programs to teach Americans about the issue (68%). \n        \n \nYale University Americans’ Knowledge of Climate Change 13 \nDetailed Results \n \n \n \nQ1. Recently, you may have noticed that global warming has been getting some attention in the \nnews.

Recently, you may have noticed that global warming has been getting some attention in \nthe news.  Global warming refers to the idea that the world’s average temperature has been \nincreasing over the past 150 years, may be increasing more in the future, and that the world’s \nclimate may change as a result. What do you think? Do you think that global warming is \nhappening?
