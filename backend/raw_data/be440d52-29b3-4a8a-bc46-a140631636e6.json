The main purposes of NMSSA are: \n• to provide a snapshot of student achievement against the NZC; \n• to identify factors that are associated with achievement;  \n• to assess strengths and weaknesses across the  curriculum;  \n• to measure change in student achievement over time; and \n• to provide high quality, robust information for policy makers, curriculum planners and educators. \nNMSSA began in 2012 and is carried out over a five-year cycle. It focuses on two learning areas of the \nNZC each year. During the first cycle we are setting the baseline for measuring change in student \nachievement over time in subsequent cycles. This report is the full technical report of the national level \nfindings from NMSSA prepared for the Ministry of Education.  \nIn 2013 the National Monitoring Study of Student Achievement (NMSSA) assessed student achievement in \ntwo learning areas of the NZC – health and physical education, and mathematics and statistics. This report \nfocuses on health and physical education. Physical Education is referred to as ‘PE’ in tables and graphs, \nand the titles of tables and graphs. \nThe NZC expresses learning expectations in health and physical education as achievement objectives that \ndescribe the knowledge and skills students should be able to display as they progress from one curriculum \nlevel to the next. Each level builds on the one before, as well as introducing new ideas and skills. Learning \nobjectives are presented across four strands: personal health and physical development, movement concepts \nand motor skills, relationships with other people, and healthy communities and environments.  \nNMSSA assessed achievement in health and physical education in two ways: by using a measure of Critical \nThinking in Health and Physical Education; and descriptive reporting of students’ understanding of well-\nbeing, and the demonstration of a range of movement and strategic action skills within the contexts of \ngames, and movement sequences. The Critical Thinking in Health and Physical Education achievement \nmeasure was aligned to the levels of the NZC. Other data related to students’, teachers’ and principals’ \nviews of teaching and learning in health and physical education were also collected via questionnaires. \nThe NZC sets out the requirements for different levels of the curriculum in each learning area.  The \nexpectations for student learning at Level 2 of health and physical education are that students should be \nable to describe or be familiar with basic concepts in these areas. A student may be able to achieve at Level \n2 on the basis on family/whānau experiences outside school, whole school learning, or other forms of prior \nknowledge. The results from NMSSA’s 2013 study showed that over 95 percent of students at Year 4 were \nachieving at Level 2 of the NZC. Level 4 of the curriculum is naturally more demanding: students are \nexpected to be able to explain and discuss or demonstrate knowledge and understanding of particular \nconcepts. To achieve at Level 4 of the curriculum students need to have been exposed to specific health and \nphysical education teaching.  A similar pattern may also occur in learning areas such as science and social \nstudies. The 2013 study suggests that by Year 8 only 50 percent of students were achieving at Level 4 of \nthe curriculum.   \nThere was considerable variation in performance at both Year 4 and Year 8, as well as a level of overlap \nbetween score distributions for each year level. The difference in achievement (‘progress’) between Year 4 \nand Year 8 was smaller than that recorded for NMSSA Mathematics (2013) or Writing (2012), and similar \nto that reported for Science (2012). In considering these findings it is important to understand both the \nrequirements of the NZC and the context in which learning occurs for health and physical education.  \n  \n 8 NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013 \nSocio-economic factors were strongly associated with performance. This pattern was similar to findings in \nNMSSA 2012, for both Science and Writing (and in previous NEMP reports). On average, students from \nlow decile schools (deciles 1, 2 and 3) scored lower than those who attended high decile schools (deciles 8, \n9, and 10). At each year level, the difference in average scores between these groups was equivalent to the \namount of progress expected over about two years of schooling. On average, NZ European students scored \nat higher levels on the Critical Thinking in Health and Physical Education measure than Māori and Pasifika \nstudents at each year level Although Māori and Pasifika students were more likely to attend low and mid \ndecile schools, analyses showed that differences due to ethnicity (NZ European, Māori and Pasifika) were \nobservable after decile was taken into account.  \nGirls and boys performed equally well on the Critical Thinking in Health and Physical Education measure \nat each year level, as did students from different types of school.  \nStudents demonstrated a broad understanding of well-being that extended beyond the physical dimension. \nA high proportion of students were able to describe mental/emotional and social dimensions, although a \nmuch smaller proportion described a spiritual dimension to well-being.  \nStudents’ movement skills developed considerably from Year 4 to Year 8. Boys scored higher on a range of \nmovement skills, and strategic action skills that included rotation, agility, and balance in the context of \ngames. Girls scored slightly higher on performing movement sequences skills that included control and use \nof equipment, change of pace, level, and use of their bodies, as well as variations in movements, and use of \nspace. Students in high decile schools scored higher on the range of movement and strategic action skills, \nand markedly higher on the movement sequences skills. These gender and decile differences in movement \nskills are longstanding and were also observed through the NEMP studies. \nThe study provides some evidence, based on the specific survey items used by NMSSA, that contextual \nfactors such as attitudes towards health and physical education, and learning experiences at school are only \nweakly related to student achievement.  \nIn general, physical education had a higher priority in schools’ teaching programmes than health (being \nranked 7th/8th compared to 11th/12th out of 17 aspects of learning areas). Priorities differed by school decile. \nAt Year 4, a greater proportion of low decile schools placed a high priority on health and physical \neducation while at Year 8, similar proportions of low, mid and high decile schools assigned both high and \nlow priorities to health and physical education. Due to these decile differences in priority ranking it was not \npossible to determine if a relationship existed between school priority ranking and achievement in health \nand physical education. \nTeachers reported relatively high levels of professional development and support. Over two thirds of \nteachers had received professional development in health and physical education in the last two years \ncompared to one third in Science (NMSSA, 2012) 1 . Teachers also reported higher confidence and \nenjoyment in their teaching of health and physical education than was the case for NMSSA English: \nwriting or Science (2012)2. The most frequently cited source of support for classroom teaching was \nexternal providers. \n \n                                                        \n1  National Monitoring Study of Student Achievement, Science 2012, Educational Assessment Research Unit, Otago University  \nand the New Zealand Council for Educational Research   \n2  National Monitoring Study of Student Achievement, Writing 2012, Educational Assessment Research Unit, Otago University  \nand the New Zealand Council for Educational Research. \n NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013: Chapter 1 9 \n1 Overview of the National Monitoring Study of Student Achievement \n1. Purpose of national monitoring \nThe National Monitoring Study of Student Achievement (NMSSA) – Wānangatia Te Putanga Tauira – is \ndesigned to assess and understand student achievement across the curriculum at Year 4 and Year 8 in New \nZealand’s English-medium state schools. The main purposes of NMSSA are: \n• To provide a snapshot of student achievement against the New Zealand Curriculum (NZC); \n• To identify factors that are associated with achievement;  \n• To assess strengths and weaknesses across the curriculum;  \n• To measure change in student achievement over time; and \n• To provide high quality, robust information for policy makers, curriculum planners and educators. \nThe information on educational outcomes and associated factors that is provided through NMSSA will \ncontinue the monitoring undertaken by the National Education Monitoring Project (NEMP) between 1995 and \n2010 and complement international studies such as the Trends in International Mathematics and Science \nStudy (TIMSS) and the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) and other national \nevaluation studies. \nThe project covers all areas of the NZC, and includes a focus on both key competencies and literacy and \nmathematics across the curriculum. NMSSA has a particular focus on Māori students, Pasifika students and \nstudents with special education needs. \nContextual information is collected to help understand the factors that are associated with student \nachievement. This includes students’ attitudes to, and the opportunities to learn in, the specific learning \narea being investigated, as well as features of their educational experiences at school and home that support \ntheir learning. Teachers provide information about factors such as their confidence to teach the specific \nlearning area under investigation, learning opportunities provided to students, and the professional and \ncurriculum support they receive.  \nEach year NMSSA focuses on two learning areas. During the course of a cycle, all learning areas of the \ncurriculum, as well as cross-curriculum elements such as key competencies and literacy and mathematics \nacross the curriculum, will be monitored. Annual reports of student achievement and factors associated \nwith each learning area will be compiled. Trends and changes in student achievement within learning areas \nwill be monitored through subsequent cycles. While aspects of student achievement on the key \ncompetencies and literacy and mathematics across the curriculum will be assessed each year, reports on \nthese aspects will be produced at the end of each cycle rather than annually (see http://nmssa.otago.ac.nz/). \nThe project is supported by advisory panels of curriculum experts, reference groups for the priority learner \ngroups (Māori, Pasifika and special education needs), and a technical reference group.  \n  \n 10 Chapter 1: NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013 \n2. The 2013 Study \nIn 2013, the dual focus for the NMSSA study was mathematics and statistics, and health and physical \neducation (PE). A nationally representative sample of approximately 2000 students at each year level took \ngroup-administered paper-and-pencil assessments in mathematics and statistics, and responded to questions \nabout their attitudes, learning experiences and support for learning. A nationally representative sub-sample \nof approximately 800 students at each year level also took part in individual assessments in health and \nphysical education through one-to-one video-recorded interviews and performance activities. Trialing \nrevealed that paper-and-pencil assessment did not permit a sufficiently valid assessment of the learning \narea. Individual assessments were also used for assessing aspects of learning in mathematics and statistics.  \nThe assessments were conducted during Term 3 by experienced, specially trained classroom teachers, with \nsound cultural awareness. Monitoring procedures ensured consistent and high quality administration of \nassessments and marking. The characteristics of the achieved samples are described in Appendix 1. \nAs well, at each year level, up to three teachers from each of the schools involved in the study were invited \nto respond to a questionnaire about their confidence in teaching mathematics and statistics, and health and \nphysical education, learning opportunities provided for students, and professional support they received for \nteaching these learning areas. Principals were invited to respond to a questionnaire about priority learning \nareas within the school, and the arrangements for teaching the focus learning areas.  \n3. Structure of the health and physical education report \nThe report of student achievement in health and physical education is set out in seven chapters: \n• Chapter 1 provides a broad overview of the National Monitoring Study of Student Achievement \nprogramme. \n• Chapter 2 provides an overview of the the health and physical education learning area and sets out the \ndevelopment of the achievement measures and data collection instruments. The analytical and reporting \napproaches used to present the findings are also set out in this chapter. \n• Chapter 3 presents the findings for Year 4 and Year 8 student achievement and reports these against \nlevels of the NZC health and physical education using a NMSSA Critical Thinking in Health and \nPhysical Education scale. It also compares achievement between Year 4 and Year 8 students, and \ndifferences between sub-groups of gender, ethnicity, school decile and type of school. Students’ \nunderstanding of well-being, and their ability to perform a range of movement skills, strategic actions \nwithin the context of authentic games, and movement sequences are reported separately and \ndescriptively. \n• Chapter 4 examines factors that may be associated with student achievement in health and physical \neducation and draws on information collected from students about their attitudes to health and physical \neducation, their learning experiences in health and physical education at school and their involvement \nin physical activities outside of school. This is examined alongside information collected from teachers \nabout their confidence to teach health and physical education, the learning experiences they provide for \nstudents, professional support they receive for teaching health and physical education and the school \nlearning priorities.  \n• Chapter 5 reports the achievement of Māori students in health and physical education for Year 4 and \nYear 8 students, and for sub-groups by gender, school decile and type of school. The characteristics of \nMāori students who achieve above the benchmark (the national average) are examined in relation to \ngender, attitude to health, attitude to physical education and school decile. \n• Chapter 6 presents the achievement of Pasifika students in health and physical education in a parallel \nway to Māori students in Chapter 5.  \n• Chapter 7 reports the participation and achievement of students who have special education needs. \nAchievement, attitudes to health and physical education, and opportunitunites to learn health and \nphysical education are also contrasted with those for students with no special education needs. The \nprofile of students with special education needs who score above the benchmark are examined in \nrelation to gender, attitude to health, attitude to physical education and school decile.\n NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013: Chapter 2 11 \n2 The NMSSA Health and Physical Education Assessment Programme \nThis chapter provides an overview of the NMSSA assessment programme for health and physical \neducation. It includes seven parts. \n• Part 1 describes health and physical education in the New Zealand Curriculum (NZC). \n• Part 2 sets out the health and physical education assessment overview for NMSSA.  \n• Parts 3 and 4 describe the components of the assessment programme, design processes, the scale \ndeveloped for reporting health and physical education achievement, movement achievement tasks, \nand other assessment information collected. \n• Parts 5 and 6 describe the instruments for gaining student, teacher and principal perspectives on \nlearning and teaching health and physical education in their schools. \n• Part 7 provides information about the data analysis and how the findings are reported.  \n1. Assessing health and physical education performance  \nin New Zealand  \nThe aim of the 2013 NMSSA health and physical education study was to assess and begin to understand the \nachievement and progress of Year 4 and Year 8 students in this learning area of the NZC. \nThe NZC provides a framework rather than a detailed plan for teaching and learning. Schools are expected \nto determine the detail of their own school-based curriculum, while staying clearly aligned with the intent \nof the NZC document. According to the NZC document (p. 37), the NZC  \n… gives schools the scope, flexibility, and authority they need to design and shape their \ncurriculum so that teaching and learning is meaningful and beneficial to their particular \ncommunities of students. In turn, the design of each school’s curriculum should allow \nteachers the scope to make interpretations in response to the particular needs, interests, and \ntalents of individuals and groups of students in their classes. \nAt the core of the health and physical education learning area are four interdependent concepts: hauora, \nattitudes and values, socio-ecological perspective and health education. The learning area covers four strands: \npersonal health and physical development, movement concepts and motor skills, relationships with other \npeople, and healthy communities and environments. The achievement objectives of the health and physical \neducation learning area have as their focus the well-being of the students, of other people, and of society \nthrough learning in and about health-related and movement contexts. Seven key areas of learning (KALS) \nprovide the contexts for learning in health and physical education: physical activity, sport studies, mental \nhealth, food and nutrition, body care and physical safety, sexuality education, and outdoor education.   \nHealth and physical education encompasses three different but related aspects: health education, physical \neducation, and home economics. Through health education students develop and use a range of “skills and \nunderstandings to take critical action to promote personal, interpersonal and societal well-being” (NZC, \np.23). Through physical education students are encouraged to “engage in movement experiences that \npromote and support the development of physical and social skills. It fosters critical thinking and action…” \n(NZC, p. 23)  Through home economics students “develop personal and interpersonal understandings and \nskills that contribute to well-being” (NZC, p. 23).  \n 12 Chapter 2: NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013 \nAt Level 2 the expectations of students are at a more exploratory, experiential level. Students at Year 4 \nshould be able to ‘describe’,‘experience’,‘identify’, ‘practise’, ‘participate in’, ‘use’, ‘develop and apply’, \n‘express’, ‘explore’, and ‘contribute to’ aspects focused around themselves and groups. At Level 4 there is \nan increasing expectation to engage with specific knowledge, skills and understandings. Year 8 students \nshould also be able to ‘demonstrate’, ‘access and use’, ‘recognise’, ‘investigate’ and ‘specify’ aspects \nfocused more around at the level of others and the community. \nThe 2013 NMSSA health and physical education study complements the precursor to NMSSA, the \nNational Education Monitoring Project (NEMP).  \nThe NEMP project was carried out by the University of Otago for the Ministry of Education. The project \nbegan in 1995 and assessed the achievement of New Zealand Year 4 and Year 8 students in all areas of the \nschool curriculum. NEMP conducted monitoring in health and physical education at four-yearly intervals \ncommencing in 1998. NEMP’s last report on health and physical education3 discussed data collected in the \n2006 school year. The report noted that Year 8 students scored higher on tasks than those in Year 4, \nparticularly in terms of the knowledge and understandings in health of personal health and development, \nrelationships with others, healthy communities and environment, and in movement skills (PE). There were \nvery slight gains between 2002 and 2006, but more notably in Year 8 students’ understanding of \nrelationships with other people. NEMP reported differences between key population sub-groups by \naveraging effect size differences across the series of tasks used to assess achievement in the study.  \nTable 2.1 shows the average effect size differences reported for gender and ethnicity in 2006. \nTable 2.1 Effect size differences between sub-groups reported by NEMP in 2006 \n Health  Movement Skills \n \nYear 4  \nEffect Size \nYear 8  \nEffect Size \nYear 4  \nEffect Size \nYear 8  \nEffect Size \nGender     \nBoys/Girls -.09 -.20 0.10 0.10 \nEthnicity4     \nPākehā/ Māori 0.25 0.23 -.09 -0.06 \nPākehā/Pasifika 0.26 0.32 -.09 0.10 \nSocio-economic effects were evident. Students in high decile schools (deciles 8, 9 and 10) did better than \nstudents in other decile schools on just over 40 percent of the health tasks and on about 30 percent of the \nmovement skills tasks. \n  \n                                                        \n3  Flockton, L. & Crooks, T., (2007).

The NMSSA health and physical education assessment overview \nAn advisory panel of health and physical education experts met with the NMSSA team to consider the \nhealth and physical education learning area of the NZC, including literacy and mathematics demands and \nopportunities to develop key competencies. The panel also identified key contextual questions to better \nunderstand students’ achievement in health and physical education. In addition, the discussion with the \nadvisory panel considered the aspects of the health and physical education achievement objectives that \ncould reasonably be assessed through NMSSA. The advice from the advisory panel formed the basis for the \nNMSSA health and physical education assessment overview.  \nThe advisory panel identified three important conceptual areas encompassed within the learning area of \nheath and physical education: critical thinking, critical action, and creative thinking.  \nCritical thinking includes thinking about: \n• self and others: Understanding different perspectives and points of view, justifying one’s opinions \nand attitudes; \n• information: Examining, analysing, critiquing, and challenging information; \n• society: Understanding the impacts of (social, environmental, economic, political, cultural) \ndeterminants on well-being. \nCritical action includes action for: \n• self: An understanding of strategies and the ability to manage healthy lifestyles and relationships, \nrisk and resilience etc; \n• others: The ability to plan and engage in health promotion to bring about change as individuals and \ncollectively. \nCreative thinking supports and enhances well-being for oneself and others and includes: \n• an understanding of visioning and big picture thinking; \n• the ability to engage in problem solving and find solution; \n• an ability to express oneself through movement and to interpret the movement of others. \nThese conceptual areas provided the foundation for the assessment overview that is set out in Table 2.2. \nSeveral ‘big questions’ identified the important or significant issues to explore in health and physical \neducation. These led to a number of more ‘specific questions’ relating to (i) assessing achievement in \nhealth and physical education and (ii) understanding achievement in health and physical education. The \nspecific questions were used to guide the development of the different components that made up the \nNMSSA health and physical education assessment programme. The overview was used to guide and \nprioritise the development of the different components that made up the NMSSA health and physical \neducation assessment programme. \nThe achievement objectives of health and physical education study formed the basis of the assessment \nprogramme and the assessment tasks the students participated in. As NMSSA is conducted in randomly \nselected schools across the country, it is impractical for us to place emphasis on those aspects of health and \nphysical education that require specialist equipment and/or facilities that are not available at all schools. As \na result, the 2013 assessment programme did not include the practical cooking of food as part of the home \neconomics focus or the assessment of swimming as part of the focus of physical education. Achievement \nobjectives relating to home economics were covered in a task related to eating together while those related \nto swimming were covered in a task related to water safety. These assessment tasks covered critical \nthinking and critical action. This is explained further in the following section. \n \n  \n 14 Chapter 2: NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013 \nTable 2.2 The Health and PE Assessment Overview \nBig questions \n• To what extent have students developed the knowledge, skills and movement capabilities, \nunderstandings, motivations, attitudes, and values to reflect on the nature of well-being and take \naction to promote their own and others’ well-being? \n• To what extent do students demonstrate these understandings across diverse health- and \nmovement-related contexts? \n• To what extent do contextual factors influence the development of knowledge, skills and movement \ncapabilities, understandings, motivations, attitudes, and values? \n• To what extent do students demonstrate progress in health and PE between Year 4 and Year 8? \nAssessing achievement: specific questions \nReflecting on the nature of well-being  \n• What are students’ understandings about the inter-relationships between health, well-being, and \nmovement?   \n• To what extent do students recognise the factors that influence their health and well-being, and \nthat of others in their community, and determine possible action to enhance and promote well-\nbeing? \n• What understandings about strategies have students developed to maintain their well-being?  \n• How do students interpret health and physical activity/movement messages and to what extent are \nthey able to critique and prioritise and act on these messages? \nTaking action to promote well-being across a range of contexts \n• What strategies and actions do students know about to help promote the well-being of themselves \nand others? \n• To what extent can students use their understandings of the factors that influence their health and \nwell-being, and that of others in their community, to plan and carry out health-promoting actions?   \n(For example, to what extent are students able to bring together their conceptual understandings \nand their applied understandings to take action?) \n• To what extent are students able to demonstrate knowledge and skills for well-being in movement \nand health-related contexts? \nKnowledge skills and understandings in movement contexts \n• To what extent are students able to demonstrate knowledge and skills in movement contexts? \n• What are students’ understandings about why they and others do or do not participate in \nmovement experiences/contexts? \n• To what extent are students able to draw on their own cultural experience and practices in \nmovement experiences/contexts? \nUnderstanding achievement: specific questions \nStudents \n• To what extent do students demonstrate motivation, engagement and interest in learning health \nand PE? \n• What is the nature and range of learning experiences students have in health and PE at school and \nout of school?    \n• To what extent do students identify and evaluate movement activities they participate in? \n• To what extent have students developed an understanding of the holistic nature of well-being and \nhow aspects of well-being are connected? \nTeachers  \n• How confident do teachers feel to teach health and PE and how well supported are they?  \n• How confident are teachers in accommodating children with differentiated needs?

All asessments involved an \nindividual assessment approach (teacher assessors interacting with individuals or groups of students) and \ncovered achievement objectives from the four strands of the curriculum and contexts from the seven key \nareas of learning. In the NMSSA context there are some achievement objectives and some key areas of \nlearning that are more constrained in their assessment opportunties because of the limited knowledge a \nteacher assessor has of individual students or logistical limitations, e.g. assessing personal growth and \ndevelopment from a sexuality perspective or assessing student skills in acquatics.  \nThe first component focused on the constructs of critical thinking, critical action and creative thinking in \nhealth and physical education. It covered the four strands (personal health and physical development, \nmovement concepts and motor skills, relationships with other people, and healthy communities and \nenvironments) and the seven key areas of learning (mental health, sexuality education, food and nutrition, \nbody care and physical safety, physical activity, sport studies and outdoor education).  \nEach of the Key Areas of Learning (KAL) were addressed in the first component, but not all aspects of each \nKAL were suitable for assessment in the NMSSA context. For example, a Water Safety task was included that \nassessed physical safety and outdoor education, but it was not feasible to assess aquatic skills. The Eating \nTogether task assessed the area of food and nutrition as part of healthy communities but it was not feasible to \nassess practical cooking skills. The New School and Magazine Ads tasks assessed mental health, sexuality, and \nbody care and physical safety. However, the advisory panel did not consider it appropriate for NMSSA to assess \nthe aspect of puberty within sexuality.  \nThe assessment framework in Appendix 2 sets out the aspects of the KALs, strands and conceptual \nunderstandings (critical thinking, critical action and creative thinking). This component included all items from \nsix tasks and one critical thinking item from a movement skills task. Results were reported on a scale \nnamed Critical Thinking in Health and Physical Education. See Part 4 for more details of this scale. \nThe second component assessed three separately described aspects of health and physical education related \nto students’ understanding of well-being, their demonstration of a range of movement skills in the contexts \nof authentic games and movement sequences, and the frequency of physical activities engaged in outside of \nschool. These constructs were reported separately and descriptively.  \nThe three remaining components focused on collecting contextual and attitudinal information from \nstudents, teachers and principals. Table 2.3 outlines the components.  \nEach component of the assessment programme is described in more depth in the following sections. \n  \n 16 Chapter 2: NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013 \nTable 2.3 The components of the 2013 NMSSA Health and PE Assessment Programme \nComponent Focus Assessment Approach \n1.

The critical thinking in health and physical education assessment \nThe scope of the assessment of achievement in health and physical education focused on the components \ndescribed in Table 2.3 above. It included opportunities for using the knowledge, attitudes and values that \nare expressed as key competencies in the NZC, e.g. thinking; language, symbols and text; and relating to \nothers. Appendix 2 outlines the assessment framework in terms of: the task title, strand, key area of \nlearning, and assessment approach.  \nIn total, 10 NMSSA individual tasks were used to provide coverage of the important aspects of health and \nphysical education as described above. \nPiloting and trialing of tasks \nA series of tasks based on the framework were developed and piloted in Dunedin schools before being used \nin a NMSSA trial involving schools around New Zealand. The student responses from the pilot and trial \nwere used to refine the tasks and support the development of appropriate scoring guides. An Item Response \nTheory (IRT) model was also applied to the data after the trial to help refine the tasks, explore the \ndevelopment of a reporting scale and inform the selection of tasks for the main study.  \n NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013: Chapter 2 17 \nThe 2013 NMSSA health and physical education study \nTeacher assessors were trained in the administration of tasks during a five-day training programme prior to the \nmain study. During the study a selection of tasks was administered to eight students in each school. Teacher \nassessors were carefully monitored and received feedback to ensure consistency of administration. Student \nresponses were captured on video and paper, and stored electronically for marking. Approximately 800 \nstudents in the main study completed the tasks in health and physical education at each of Year 4 and Year 8.  \nMarking \nTeacher markers, some of whom had been teacher assessors, were employed to mark the tasks. All markers \nwere trained, and quality assurance procedures were used to ensure consistency of marking. The marking \nschedules were refined as necessary to ensure they reflected the range of responses found in the main study. \nStudents’ scores were entered directly by the markers into the electronic database. \nCreating the Critical Thinking in Health and Physical Education scale \nAn IRT model (the Rasch Model) was applied to all student responses from the items/tasks in component \none to construct a measurement scale. The scale was named ‘Critical Thinking in Health and PE’ to \nhighlight the focus of the construct. The full title of the scale is used throughout the report to remind the \nreader that this is the construct being assessed. The scale locates both student achievement and relative task \ndifficulty on the same measurement continuum using scale scores.  \nThe scale has been constructed so that the average scale score for the combined sample of Year 4 and Year \n8 students was 100 scale score units, and the approximate standard deviation for a year level was 20 scale \nscore units. Scale scores ranged from about 20 to 180 scale score units. \nFurther details about the measurement scale and its construction can be found in Part 6 of this chapter. \nScale description  \nFigure 2.1 describes the knowledge and competencies associated with tasks located at different parts of the \nCritical Thinking in Health and Physical Education scale. The descriptions are provided in three broad \nbands, along with examples of the task contexts in which the knowledge and competencies were displayed. \nTo develop the description, the scoring categories associated with each task were located on the scale where \nscoring in that category was most probable. The demands of each scoring category were examined and used to \ncraft descriptions across three bands of the scale. The descriptions for each band were organised around the \nthree focus areas of the Critical Thinking in Health and Physical Education assessment. \nThe scale description is used in later chapters to aid interpretation of the data.  \n4. The well-being and movement skills assessment \nA paper-and-pencil task followed by a one-to-one interview asssesed students’ understanding of well-\nbeing. Two activity tasks used the context of an authentic game to assess students’ performance on a range \nof movment and strategic action skills, and a further activity task assessed students’ movement sequences. \nThe details of the Well-being and Movement Skills tasks and how students’ responses were coded are \nprovided in Chapter 3. Student performance on these tasks are reported descriptively and complement the \naspects of the learning area not covered by the Critical Thinking in Health and Physical Education scale. \nThe well-being items were not included in the scale because the different range of contexts in which \nstudents study well-being meant that it was not possible to construct a task that would be equally accessible \nto all students. The task used did not ask students to create categories/dimensions of well-being, but \nclassified their open-ended responses using a categorisation based on the Hauora model. The task therefore \nenabled an exploratory study of students’ awareness of different dimensions of well-being.  \nThe movement skills items were not included in the scale (with the exception of one item about strategy) \nbecause they did not form part of the construct of critical thinking in health and physical education and \npsychometrically did not fit on the same scale as the other tasks assessed. \n 18 Chapter 2: NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013 \n \nFigure 2.1  Scale description for Critical Thinking in Health and PE  \n   \n NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013: Chapter 2 19 \n5. Student attitudes and learning opportunities in health and physical \neducation \nA questionnaire was developed containing sections related to student attitudes towards health and physical \neducation, and how frequently students experience a set of opportunities to learn in these areas. The \nquestionnaire was the same for Year 4 and Year 8 and was administered to all students in the 2013 NMSSA \nstudy, approximately 2000 students at each year level. \nAttitudes to health and physical education \nStudents were asked about their attitudes to health and to physical education in separate sections of the \nquestionnaire. Each section asked students how much they agreed with a number of statements related to \ntheir feelings of self efficacy in health and physical education, and level of engagement in health and \nphysical education learning. Students used a four-point agreement scale to respond to each statement (‘Do \nnot agree at all’, ‘Agree a little’, ‘Agree quite a lot’; and ‘Agree heaps’). The statements from the attitude to \nhealth section were: \n• I usually do well in learning about health. \n• I am good at learning about health. \n• My teacher thinks I am good at learning about health. \n• I think learning about health is interesting. \n• I like learning about health at school. \n• I would like to learn more about health at school. \n• I want to keep learning about health when I grow up. \n• I learn useful things in health at school. \nThe statements from the Attitude to Physical Education section were: \n• I usually do well in PE. \n• I am good at PE. \n• My teacher thinks I am good at PE. \n• I think PE is interesting. \n• I like doing PE at school. \n• I would like to do more PE at school. \n• I want to keep learning about PE as I grow up. \n• I learn useful things in PE at school. \nDraft versions of the attitudes to health and physical education sections were piloted with small groups of \nstudents, before being used in a development trial with several hundred students at Year 4 and Year 8. \nResponses from the trial were analysed using an IRT model and the results used to inform the development \nof the final set of statements used in the 2013 NMSSA health and physical education study.  \nAfter the main study, an IRT model was applied to both sets of attitude questions in order to construct \nreporting scales. Each scale allows the strength of each student’s overall response to the set of statements to \nbe located on a measurement continuum. Students who responded positively to a large number of \nstatements were given high scale scores. Students whose responses were more negative overall received \nlower scale scores. As with other NMSSA scales, this scale has been set to have an average of 100 scale \nunits and a standard deviation of 20 scale units.  \n  \n 20 Chapter 2: NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013 \nOpportunities to learn in health and physical education \nTwo other sections of the questionnaire asked students about the opportunities they had to learn health and \nphysical education respectively. Students used a four-point scale (Not at all, A little, Quite a lot, and \nHeaps) to show how often they experienced different opportunities to be involved in health and physical \neducation learning activities. The statements from the learning opportunities in physical education section \nwere: \n• Use equipment to play and move around. \n• Have challenges like making up movement patterns or solving problems. \n• Work in teams or groups. \n• Learn about playing fair. \n• Learn how to be safe when I am moving in different ways. \n• Learn new skills and different ways of moving. \nThe learning opportunities statements in health were: \n• Work in groups to think about and discuss things in health \n• Learn something in health that is important to me \n• Take action to improve my health after learning something in class \n• Share things I’ve learned about health with others (e.g. make a poster, talk to people, write a letter) \n• My whole class does things that help me learn about health  \nDraft lists of learning opportunities were piloted and trialled and a final list for each of health and physical \neducation selected for use in the main study. Results from the 2013 study are reported as the percentages of \nstudents selecting the different response categories for each learning opportunity. \n6. Teacher and principal perspectives on health and physical education \nteaching and learning in the school  \nThe teacher questionnaire was developed to collect teachers’ perspectives on health and physical education \nteaching and learning in their schools. It included questions related to their confidence as health and \nphysical education educators, the types of health and physical education learning activities and experiences \nthat they provided for their students, and opportunities they had received for professional development.  \nThe principal questionnaire collected principals' perspectives on ranking learning area by the priority given \nto them within their school, and provisions related to health and physical education teaching and learning in \ntheir school.  \nThe questionnaires were piloted with teacher focus groups and interviews with principals from a range of \nschools before being used in the main study. Up to three teachers in each school in the main study \n(including specialist teachers of health and/or physical education) and the principal were invited to \ncomplete the questionnaires. \n  \n NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013: Chapter 2 21 \n7. Data analysis and reporting  \nIn this section we provide some technical details about the scales developed to report the health and \nphysical education results, present the graphical formats used throughout the report, and provide some \ntechnical background and rationale for some of the statistics used.  \nIRT scale construction: Critical Thinking in Health and Physical Education \nThe scale used in this report have been developed using the Rasch Model. The family of Rasch \nmeasurement models are frequently used in studies such as this (PISA 20125, TIMSS 20116).  The IRT \nsoftware package WINSTEPS (Linacre, 2009)7 was used to develop the health and physical education \nscale. Some advantages of applying the Rasch Model are: \n• both items and students can be located independently on the constructed scale;  \n• unlike raw test scores, the measurement scale units represent the same amount of change in \nachievement across the whole scale;  \n• achievement for Year 4 and Year 8 students can be located on the same measurement scale;  \n• scales can be described to show what students typically understand and are able to do at different \nparts of the scale (for example, the scale descriptions in Part 3 and Part 4 of this chapter). \nStandardising the scales \nAs described, the health and physical education and the attitudinal scales used in this report have been \ndeveloped using the Rasch model. For ease of understanding, each of the scales has been designed so that:  \n• the mean of all students (Year 4 and Year 8 combined) is equal to 100 scale units  \n• the average standard deviation for the two year levels is equal to 20 scale units  \n• this means that scores on all the scales range from around 20 to 180 scale units.   \nScale reliability \nTable 2.4 provides reliability indices for each of the reporting scales developed for use in the assessment \nprogramme. These relate to the reliability of students’ scale scores and have been calculated by the \nWINSTEPS software used to construct the scales. The overall reliabilities are satisfactory and indicate that \nfor each measure, student achievement and attitudes to health and physical education have been located on \nthe scale with a satisfactory level of precision.  \nTable 2.4 The reliability of the NMSSA measures \nMeasure Person Reliability \nCritical Thinking in Health and PE 0.81 \nAttitude to Health 0.82 \nAttitude to PE 0.79 \nReporting achievement against curriculum levels \nThe NZC provides achievement objectives for each learning area that set out selected learning processes, \nknowledge and skills relative to eight levels of learning. A curriculum alignment exercise was undertaken \nto link performance ranges on the NMSSA Critical Thinking in Health and Physical Education \nachievement scale to Levels 2 to 4 of the NZC. Creating this link allowed scale scores for the measure to be \nreported in terms of curriculum levels. Some tasks used to assess health and physical education such as \nthose related to understanding of well-being and movement skills were not included in the health and \nphysical education measure because they were distinctly different constructs.  \n                                                        \n5  PISA 2012. http://www.educationcounts.govt.nz/topics/research/pisa_research/pisa_2012 \n6  TIMSS 2011. http://www.educationcounts.govt.nz/topics/research/timss \n7  Linacre, J. M. (2009). WINSTEPS Rasch measurement computer program. Chicago: Winsteps.com \n 22 Chapter 2: NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013 \nA panel of health and physical education learning area experts took part in a curriculum alignment study to \nestablish the NMSSA scale score levels for ‘minimally competent’ Level 2 and Level 4 students. This \ndefined the score ranges on the health and physical education scale associated with  curriculum Level 2 or \nabove, and curriculum Level 4 or above for students in Years 4 and 8. \nIn the NZC each of the first four curriculum levels has been designed to represent about two years of \nlearning at school. In general, students are expected to be achieving at curriculum Level 2 by the end of \nYear 4 and curriculum Level 4 by the end of Year 8. These benchmarks are used throughout the report to \ndefine expected performance bands for each year level. \nMore information about the curriculum alignment procedures is provided in Appendix 3. \nUse of graphs in the report \nBox and whisker plots  \nThese plots are used extensively throughout this report. They are used to summarise groups of scores. \nScores are ordered from low to high and then divided into four equally sized groups, called quartile groups. \nThese are displayed as shown in Figure 2.5. \nBox: The box shows the middle 50 percent of the scores (between the 25th and 75th percentiles).  \nWhiskers: In this report, the whiskers of the box plot do not include outliers (scores that are rare and \nunusual) and have a maximum length of 1.5 × the inter-quartile range. The box plots in this report do not \ndisplay outliers.  \nColours used: Box plots for reporting scales use two colours for the middle quartile groups to make it easier \nto distinguish between them. If printed in grey scale these colours still produce a contrast. \nBox plots relating to attitudes to health and physical education are presented in a different pair of colours to \ndistinguish them from those relating to achievement. \nGrid lines: Grid lines are used on the box plots to make them easier to interpret. These are especially \nhelpful in the graphs with many box plots side by side. The grid lines on the left of the graph are placed at \nevery 40 scale score units.  \n \nFigure 2.2 Understanding box plots \n \n  \n NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013: Chapter 2 23 \nThe NZ curriculum levels that correspond  \nto scale score cut-offs are noted on the right  \nof the graph and are indicated by the grey \nhorozontal dotted lines across the graph \n(Figure 2.3). \nLine graph of score distributions \nAnother type of graph used to display data \nin this report is the line graph (Figure 2.4). \nThese are used to show how the \ndistributions of scores for various groups \ncompare with curriculum expectations.  \nHorizontal shaded bars are placed on the \nline graphs to show how the scale aligns to \nthe health and physical education learning \narea levels. These bars reflect the fact that \nthe curriculum levels themselves and the \nalignment exercise cannot provide precise \ncutpoints. Their use as an approximate \nguide is more appropriate. A detailed \nexercise was undertaken to establish the \nlocations on the scales where one \ncurriculum level merged into the next. Full \ndetails of this can be found in Appendix 3. \nCurriculum levels are always labelled \nclearly when used, and should not be \nconfused with grid lines in the box plots. \nIn graphs that display a scale, the scale is \nalways placed on the vertical axis. \nGraphs of sub-group differences \nA graph called the display of scale score \ndifferences has been developed to show the \ndifferences in scale score units between \npopulation sub-groups presented in pairs. \nAn example of this display is shown in \nFigure 2.5. The display shown provides \ncomparisons for three pairs of Year 4 sub-\ngroups on a fictional NMSSA scale: NZ \nEuropean compared to non-NZ European, \nMāori compared to non-Māori, and Pasifika \ncompared to non-Pasifika. A blue bar is \npresented for each pair. The top of each bar \nmarks the average score for the sub-group \nin each pair that scored higher overall.  \n \nFigure 2.3 Interpreting box plots and NZC level bands \n \nFigure 2.4  An example of a line graph display \nThe bottom of the bar marks the average score for the sub-group in the pair that scored lower. \nThe number above the bar indicates the difference between the two average scores in scale score units. \nThe dotted red line shows the national average score for all students in Year 4. \n  \n 24 Chapter 2: NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013 \n \nFigure 2.5 The display of Year 4 sub-group differences on a fictional NMSSA scale  \nInterpreting score differences, effect size statistics and statistical significance \nThe achievement measure developed for the NMSSA health and physical education study quantifies \ndifference in terms of scale score units. Because the same scales have been used at both Year 4 and Year 8 \nit is possible to estimate how much change on average occurs on an annual basis. Table 2.5 shows the \ndifferences in average scale scores on the health and physical education scale between Year 4 and Year 8, \nand how this relates to annualised change. As can be seen, students improved on average by about six scale \nunits per year. This figure is useful to keep in mind when interpreting scale score differences throughout \nthe report.  \nTable 2.5 Average scale score difference between Year 4 and Year 8 on Critical Thinking in Health and PE \n Critical Thinking in Health and PE \nYear 4/Year 8 difference* (scale score units) 23 \nAverage annual difference (scale score units) 6 \nEffect size 1.14 \nAverage annual effect size 0.28 \n* Difference = Year 8 - Year 4 \nTable 2.5 also shows what the scale score differences between Year 4 and Year 8 equate to in terms of \neffect sizes. As can be seen the average annual effect size is 0.28. Effect sizes have been used throughout \nthe report to help interpret differences between groups. An effect size quantifies the difference between the \naverage scores for two groups in terms of standard deviation units. The calculation of the effect sizes in this \nreport weights the standard deviation for each group by its sample size8. Because the standard deviations \nfor groups are often different, this can mean that the same difference in scale scores results in slightly \ndifferent effect sizes for different pairs of groups. When comparing two effect sizes it is important to refer \nback to the scale score differences. \n  \n                                                        \n8  The formula for the effect size calculation is: 𝑀1−𝑀2\n�(𝑛1−1)𝑠12+ (𝑛2−1)𝑠22\n𝑛1+𝑛2−2\n, where M1 and M2 represent the average scores for group 1 and group 2, s1 \nand s2 their standard deviations, and n1and n2 the number in each group. \n NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013: Chapter 2 25 \nNinety-five percent confidence intervals have been calculated for each effect size reported and used to \ndetermine when an effect is statistically significant. When an effect is statistically significant it means that \nthe data support the hypothesis that the effect size is real (non zero). Statistically significant effect sizes are \nshown in bold text in the tables of findings. The confidence intervals have been adjusted to account for any \ndesign effect created through the sampling procedure (i.e. sampling schools and then sampling students). \nAs well as considering statistical significance, it is also important to consider the size of the effect. When \ngroups are large (as for NMSSA), relatively small effects can be statistically significant. \nEffect sizes have been used to examine: \n• the difference in achievement between Year 4 and Year 8 students  \n• the difference between subgroups of students (girls/boys; NZ European/Non-NZ European, Māori/ \nNon-Māori, Pasifika/Non-Pasifika students; schools of high, mid and low decile; and types of \nschool (at Year 4 - full primary, and contributing; at Year 8 - composite, full primary, \nintermediate, and secondary). \nDifferences between the effect sizes for different pairs of comparisons were considered notable \n(significant) when the confidence intervals (adjusted for design effect) surrounding the respective effect \nsizes were non-overlapping. The average annual effect size between Year 4 and Year 8 student \nachievement (0.28) is used as a guideline to interpret sub-group effect sizes in terms of years of progress. \nThe use of rounding \nThe average score for each group and sub-group have been rounded to whole numbers. Some tables of \nfindings report the difference between average scale score units for two groups or sub-groups. The scale \nscore differences have been calculated using non-rounded numbers, and are numerically correct. In some \ncases the scale score difference may not be the same as the simple difference in the pair of averages \nreported in the table. \n \n 26 Chapter 3: NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013 \n3 Student Achievement in Health and Physical Education \nThis chapter describes Year 4 and Year 8 student achievement in health and physical education (PE) based \non the measure of health and physical education achievement developed for the NMSSA study: Critical \nThinking in Health and Physical Education. It also reports descriptively other important aspects of health \nand physical education: students’ understanding of well-being and movement skills. It examines how \nachievement varies within and between year levels, including variation by gender, ethnicity, school decile \nand type of school. Achievement is reported against the levels of the New Zealand Curriculum (NZC).  \nThe chapter is organised into five parts. The first and second parts consider achievement for Year 4 and \nYear 8 students respectively on the Critical Thinking in Health and Physical Education measure. The third \npart examines achievement by decile and ethnicity, and the fourth part compares achievement between the \ntwo year levels. The fifth part examines aspects of the health and physical education assessment in greater \ndetail. It also provides descriptive reporting on students’ understanding of well-being and movement skills. \nTables and graphs are used throughout the chapter to display results. For many of the tables, particularly \nthose associated with population sub-groups, fuller tables of means, standard deviations, sample sizes, \neffect sizes and 95 percent confidence intervals can be found in Appendix 4.  \n NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013: Chapter 3 27 \nSuccess and achievement of students in health and physical education \n– An overview \nAchievement against curriculum levels \nStudents’ performance in health and physical education was assessed using the Critical Thinking \nin Health and Physical Education measure which was aligned to the New Zealand Curriculum \n(NZC) levels in health and physical education. Almost all Year 4 students scored within \ncurriculum Level 2 or above, and just over half of Year 8 students scored within Level 4 or above. \nYear 4 students were exceeding the expectations expressed in the NZC. Year 8 students were \nachieving below curriculum expectations.  \nAchievement of sub-groups \nThere was a wide distribution of scores at both year levels and considerable overlap in the \nachievement of Year 4 students and Year 8 students. Analysis of population sub-groups showed \nthat on average, achievement varied by ethnicity and school decile, but not by gender or school \ntype.  For both year levels average scores on Critical Thinking in Health and Physical Education \nwere lower for Māori and Pasifika students than for non-Māori and non-Pasifika students \nrespectively. Average scores were also lower for students from lower decile schools. These \npatterns are consistent with those observed in health and physical education in NEMP from 1998, \n2002, and 2006, and in science and writing in NMSSA, 2012.  \nAn analysis to examine differences in achievement by decile and ethnicity identified separate \neffects of both. When decile differences were accounted for, ethnicity differences in achievement \non Critical Thinking in Health and Physical Education remained. Differences evident in average \nscores on Critical Thinking in Health and Physical Education for Māori and Pasifika students and \nNZ European students were significant. This is similar to findings from NMSSA Mathematics and \nStatistics (2013) where significant ethnicity differences were also found after school decile was \ntaken into account.  \n‘Progress’ between Year 4 and Year 8 \nThe difference in average scores between Year 4 and Year 8 was used as a proxy for progress. It \nwas equivalent to an average annual effect size of 0.28, lower than that found for NMSSA \nKnowledge and Application of Mathematical and Statistical Ideas (0.36) (2013), Writing for a \nVariety of Measures (0.36), Nature of Science (0.34) and similar for that found for NMSSA \nKnowledge and Communication of Science ideas (0.30) (2012). The difference between Year 4 \nand Year 8 average scores was similar for gender, ethnicity, types of school, and school decile.  \nOn a task that assessed student perceptions of well-being, a high proportion of students at both \nyear levels were able to identify the mental/emotional and social dimensions of well-being, \nfollowed by the physical dimension. A much smaller proportion identified a spiritual dimension. \nAt both year levels, a larger proportion of girls than boys identified the social dimension.  \nStudents’ movement skills, measured in a series of naturalistic game settings and movement \nsequences developed considerably from Year 4 to Year 8. Gender and decile differences persisted \nfrom Year 4 to Year 8, reflecting longstanding differences in these areas. On average, boys scored \nhigher on a range of movement skills and strategic action skills within a game context, while girls \nscored slightly higher on performing movement sequences. More students from high decile \nschools than students from mid and low decile schools displayed higher levels of achievement on \na range of movement skills and strategic action skills within a game context.

Drawing on the scale description for this measure9 this indicates that the Year 4 \nstudents clustered around the average (the middle 50 percent) were typically able to: \n• share their understandings, ideas, or viewpoints; \n• identify factors that impact on well-being generally; \n• state practices to support their well-being; \n• recognise general health messages; \n• suggest general reasons for actions and reactions when people are responding to problems or issues; \n• join in and participate in games. \nThese students were also beginning to: \n• identify their own perspective and acknowledge alternative viewpoints; \n• identify factors that impact on the well-being of themselves and others; \n• explain strategies and actions to promote their well-being; \n• recognise general health messages and state ways to inform others about these; \n• identify specific reasons for actions and reactions when people are responding to problems/issues; \n• identify movements needed to participate in games and identify some strategies they can employ \nA curriculum alignment exercise was undertaken for the first time to link performance on the NMSSA \nCritical Thinking in Health and Physical Education achievement scale to the NZC (See Appendix 3 for \ndetails). As the curriculum is described in a very flexible way, and the scale was only designed to cover the \ncritical thinking aspect of the health and physical education curriculum, the alignment procedure could only \nvalidly be used to report Year 4 and Year 8 scale scores in terms of Level 2 and Level 4 \nrespectively.10 Table 3.2 shows that almost all Year 4 students achieved at Level 2 or above exceeding the \nexpected level of performance for Year 4 students. \nTable 3.2 Percentage of Year 4 students achieving at the NZC Health and PE level 2 on the  \nCritical Thinking in Health and PE measure \n Critical Thinking in Health and PE (%) \nLevel 2 and above 97 \nNot yet Level 2 3 \n                                                        \n \n10   This is the first time that curriculum alignment has been undertaken in NZC health and physical education. The cutoffs described in this \nreport are broad estimates. Refer to Appendix 3 for details of the procedure used. \n NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013: Chapter 3 29 \nFigure 3.1 shows the distributions of students’ scores \nacross the curriculum levels. The grey bars mark the \nthreshold areas of the different levels. They have been \nmade wide to reflect the imprecision in the exercise of \naligning assessment results to the curriculum levels. \nYear 4 achievement by sub-group \nFigure 3.2 displays the level and spread of scores for \npopulation sub-groups in Year 4 on the Critical Thinking \nin Health and Physical Educationmeasure.

Table 3.3 sets out the \naverage score, standard deviation, and number of \nstudents in each sub-group.  \nAt Year 4 there were statistically significant differences \nbetween the average scores of the ethnicity and decile sub-\ngroups. On average, NZ European students scored higher \nthan Asian students and both of these groups scored higher \nthan Māori and Pasifika students. High decile school \nstudents scored higher on average than students from mid \ndecile schools. These students in turn scored higher than \nstudents from low decile schools. \nGender and school type differences were not statistically \nsignificant. \n \nFigure 3.1 Distribution of Year 4 student \nachievement on Critical Thinking in \nHealth and PE against NZC health and PE \n \nFigure 3.2  Year 4 student achievement on Critical Thinking in Health and PE by gender, ethnicity, school decile and  \nschool type (NZ Euro=NZ European, F.P.=Full Primary, Comp.=Composite, Cont.=Contributing) \n                                                        \n11  Non-prioritised ethnicity was used where students could identify with up to three ethnicities. This meant they could be present in multiple \nethnic groups. Student ethnicity data were obtained from student NSN information held on the Ministry of Education ENROL database. The \n‘NZ European’ category included NZ Pākehā only. The 'Pasifika' category included Tokelauan, Fijian, Niuean, Tongan, Cook Islands Māori, \nSamoan and other Pacific peoples. The 'Asian' category included Filipino, Cambodian, Vietnamese, Other Southeast Asian, Indian, Chinese, \nSri Lankan, Japanese, Korean, and other Asians.

Table 3.4 summarises \naverage scale score differences and their effect sizes between sub-groups on this scale.  \nAt Year 4 there was an 18 scale score unit difference (ssud) between the average score of students \nattending high decile schools and the average score of students from low decile school, by about three \nyears’ achievement (an effect size of  -0.92). Using the average annual effect between Year 4 and Year 8 as \na guideline (see Table 3.9), this difference was equivalent to about three years of achievement). The \ndifference between low and mid decile groups was still considerable with an effect size of -0.60 (12 ssud) \nand equivalent to about two years’ achievement, while the difference between mid and high decile groups \nwas smaller with an effect size of -0.30 (6 ssud) and equivalent to about one year of achievement.  These \neffect sizes were all statistically significant.  \nNZ European students achieved higher scores on average than non-NZ European students by 12 ssud \n(effect size 0.64); non-Māori students achieved higher scores on average than Māori students by 7 ssud \n(effect size of -0.35 and Non-Pasifika students achieved higher scores on average than Pasifika students by \n16 ssud (effect size of -0.80). Again the differences are equivalent to between one and two years’ \ndifference in achievement for the different comparisons. \nIt is important to note that differences between ethnic groups may be confounded with decile differences \nand with the non-Māori group including Pasifika students who scored lower than Māori. This issue is \ndiscussed further in Chapters 5 and 6. \nThe findings indicate that the disparities between the school decile and ethnicity sub-groups are similar to \nthose found in NEMP in 1998, 2002, and 2006.

Year 8 achievement in Critical Thinking in Health and Physical \nEducation \nOverall achievement \nTable 3.5 provides the average scale score, standard deviation and sample size for Year 8 students on the \nNMSSA Critical Thinking in Health and Physical Education achievement measure. \nTable 3.5 Year 8: Overall measure of achievement on the Critical Thinking  \nin Health and PE scale \n  Critical Thinking in Health and PE \nAverage (scale score units) 111 \nSD (scale score units) 20 \nN 762 \nThe average score for Year 8 students on the Critical Thinking in Health and Physical Education measure \nwas 111 scale score units. The middle 50 percent of Year 8 students demonstrated higher levels of the \ncompetencies described for Year 4 students. They were typically able to:  \n• identify their own perspective and were in the initial stages of being able to acknowledge alternative \nviewpoints; \n• identify factors that impact on the well-being of themselves and others; \n• explain strategies and actions to promote their well-being; \n• recognise general health messages and state ways to inform others about these; \n• identify specific reasons for actions and reactions when people are responding to problems/issues; \n• identify movements needed to participate in games and identify some strategies they can employ. \nTable 3.6 and Figure 3.4 and show the distribution of \nYear 8 students’ scores on the Critical Thinking in \nHealth and Physical Education assessment across the \ncurriculum levels. Student achievement ranged from \nLevel 2 through to Level 4 or above. Just over half of \nthe Year 8 students achieved at Level 4 with the \nremainder performing at Level 3 or below. Year 8 \nstudents were therefore achieving below the expected \ncurriculum level in health and physical education. \nTable 3.6 Percentage of Year 8 students achieving at the NZC  \nhealth and PE level 4 on to the Critical Thinking in  \nHealth and PE measure \n Critical Thinking in Health and PE (%) \nLevel 4 and above 51 \nNot yet Level 4 49 \n \n \nFigure 3.4  Distribution of Year 8 student achievement \non Critical Thinking in Health and PE \nagainst NZC health and PE levels  \n NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013: Chapter 3 33 \nYear 8 achievement by sub-group \nFigure 3.5 displays the achievement results for the sub-groups in Year 8 on the Critical Thinking in Health \nand Physical Education measure.

Table 3.7 sets out, the average score, standard deviation, and number of students in each sub-group.  \nThe pattern of achievement across the sub-groups at Year 8 was similar to that at Year 4. NZ European \nstudents scored higher on average than Asian and Māori students who scored higher on average than \nPasifika students. Students attending low decile schools scored lower on average than those from mid-  \nor high decile schools. Gender and school types differences were not significant. \n \nFigure 3.5 Year 8 student achievement in Critical Thinking in Health and PE by gender, ethnicity, school decile \nand school type (NZ Euro=NZ European, F.P.=Full Primary, Comp.=Composite, Int.=Intermediate) \nTable 3.7 Year 8 student achievement on Critical Thinking in Health and PE by gender, ethnicity, school decile and \nschool type sub-groups \n Critical Thinking in Health and PE \n Average \n(scale score units) \nSD \n(scale score units) \nN \nGender    \nBoys 112 19 378 \nGirls 111 21 384 \nEthnicity       \nNZ European 116 19 455 \nMāori 108 17 188 \nPasifika 97 21 101 \nAsian 111 17 61 \nSchool Decile       \nLow 101 20 163 \nMid 111 18 361 \nHigh 120 19 238 \nSchool Type       \nFull Primary 110 20 291 \nComposite 107 18 39 \nIntermediate 112 20 331 \nSecondary 114 18 101 \n 34 Chapter 3: NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013 \nFigure 3.6 displays the differences in average scale scores between the sub-groups, illustrating their relative \ndifferences on the Critical Thinking in Health and Physical Education measure. Table 3.8 summarises the \nsub-group information, showing differences in average scale scores between sub-groups and their effect \nsizes, on this scale.  \nThe pattern of results for the different sub-groups at Year 8 was the same as that for the corresponding \ngroups at Year 4, with statistically significant differences (in average scores) between ethnicity and decile \ngroups, but not for gender or school type. The difference between Pasifika and non-Pasifika was the largest \ndifference across the ethnic groups (17 scale score units) with an effect size of 0.90. Using the average \nannual effect between Year 4 and Year 8 as a guideline (see Table 3.9). This difference is equivalent to \nabout three years’ achievement. The differences between NZ European and non-NZ European was a little \nless (12 scale score units) with an effect size of 0.63 equivalent to about two years’ achievement. The \ndifference between Māori and non-Māori was modest (5 scale score units) with an effect size of 0.25 \nequivalent to about one year’s achievement. There was no difference in the average achievement score \nbetween Asian and non-Asian students at either Year 4 or Year 8. \nThe effect sizes for to the differences in average scores between Year 8 low, mid and high decile school \nstudents ranged from -.0.49 to -0.95, with the largest difference being between low and high decile schools \n(18 scale score units). This difference was equivalent to approximately three years of achievement.  \nIt is important to note that differences between ethnic groups may be confounded with decile differences \nand with the non-Māori group including Pasifika students who scored lower than Māori. This issue is \ndiscussed further in Chapters 5 and 6. \nThere were no significant differences in achievement on the Critical Thinking in Health and Physical \nEducation scale by school type for Year 8 students.  \nThe findings at Year 8 indicate that the disparities between the school decile and ethnicity sub-groups are \nsimilar to those found in NEMP in 1998, 2002, and 2006. The lack of gender difference or differences by \nschool type is also in keeping with the NEMP findings.  \n \nFigure 3.6 Year 8 students: Difference in average scores for Critical Thinking in \nHealth and PE by sub-group (NZE=NZ European) \n  \n NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013: Chapter 3 35 \nTable 3.8 Year 8 sub-group differences on the Critical Thinking in Health and PE  scale \n  Critical Thinking in Health and PE \n Difference  \n(scale score units) \nEffect size \nGender   \nBoys/Girls 0 0.02 \nEthnicity     \nNZ European/Non-NZ European 12 0.63 \nMāori/Non-Māori -5 -0.25 \nPasifika/Non-Pasifika -17 -0.90 \nAsian/Non-Asian 0 0.01 \nSchool Decile     \nLow/Mid -9 -0.50 \nMid/High -9 -0.49 \nLow/High -18 -0.95 \nSchool Type     \nFull Primary/Intermediate -2 0.08 \nIntermediate/Secondary -2 -0.12 \nFull Primary/Secondary -4 -0.21 \nEffect sizes in bold are statistically significant (p<.05).

Achievement by decile and ethnicity \nThe previous sections have highlighted that school decile and student ethnicity are both important factors \nassociated with health and physical education achievement. It is important to note that any differences in \naverage scores between ethnic groups may be confounded with decile differences. A regression analysis \nidentified separate effects for decile and ethnicity. In other words when we accounted for decile \ndifferences, there are still differences in achievement in average scores in Critical Thinking in Health and \nPhysical Education average scores between NZ European, Māori and Pasifika students. Further details of \nthis analysis can be found in the chapters about Māori and Pasifika student achievement and in Appendix 5. \n  \n 36 Chapter 3: NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013 \n4.  Comparison of Year 4 and Year 8 achievement \nThe use of reporting scales common to both Year 4 and Year 8 makes it possible to compare achievement \nbetween the two year levels. Figure 3.7 shows the distribution of Year 4 and Year 8 students on the Critical \nThinking in Health and Physical Education scale.  \nAs expected, Year 8 students achieved \nhigher scores on average than Year 4 \nstudents. However, there was a wide \ndistribution of scores at both year levels and \nconsiderable overlap in the achievement of \nYear 4 students and Year 8 students. \nTable 3.9 shows the average scores and their \nstandard deviations on the Health and Physical \nEducation measure along with the difference \nin average scores between Year 4 and Year 8 \nstudents expressed in scale score units and as \nan effect size for the four-year difference and \nthe average effect size per year. The difference \nbetween the average score for Year 4 and Year \n8 students was 23 scale units. This represents \nan effect size of 1.14 and an average annual \neffect size of 0.28.  \n \nFigure 3.7 Year 4 and Year 8 student achievement on Critical \nThinking in Health and PE by year level \n \nTable 3.9 Overall measure of achievement in Critical Thinking in Health and PE and  \ndifference of achievement by year level  \n  Critical Thinking in Health and PE \n  Year 4 Year 8 \nAverage (scale score units) 89 111 \nSD (scale score units) 20 20 \nN 776 762 \nYear 4/Year 8 difference* 23 \nEffect size 1.14 \nAnnual average effect size 0.28 \n• Difference = Year 8-Year 4.  \nEffect sizes in bold are statistically significant (p<.05) \nThe scale score differences have been calculated using non-rounded numbers, and are numerically correct.

We use this difference to provide an estimate of progress between these year levels. Noted however \nthat this is not a measure of actual progress by a particular group of students.  \nThe difference in average scores between Year 4 and Year 8 fell between 21 and 25 scale score units across \nall comparisons. These differences are expressed as average annual effect sizes ranging from 0.26 to 0.34. The \nsub-groups showing slightly greater levels of growth were Māori students and students in high decile schools. \n  \n NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013: Chapter 3 37 \nTable 3.10 Differences on the Critical Thinking in Health and PE measure between Year 4 and Year 8 students  \nby sub-group  \n \nCritical Thinking in Health and PE \n Year 4 Average \n(scale score units) \nYear 8 Average \n(scale score units) \nDifference*  \n(scale score units) \nEffect Size Average Annual \nEffect Size \nGender           \nBoys 87 112 25 1.23 0.31 \nGirls 90 111 21 1.04 0.26 \nEthnicity           \nNZ European 93 116 23 1.25 0.31 \nMāori 83 108 25 1.35 0.34 \nPasifika 75 97 22 1.08 0.27 \nAsian 89 111 23 1.12 0.28 \nSchool Decile           \nLow 77 101 24 1.16 0.29 \nMid 89 111 21 1.16 0.29 \nHigh 95 120 25 1.37 0.34 \nDifference = Year 8 – Year 4.  \nEffect sizes in bold are statistically significant (p<.05) \nThe scale score differences have been calculated using non-rounded numbers, and are numerically correct.

Exploring achievement in health and physical education  \nIn this section we report details of students’ performance on two tasks from the Critical Thinking in Health \nand Physical Education measure. We have chosen a task that students were particularly successful on (‘Water \nSafety’) and one that students found very challenging (‘Fair Play’). In addition, we report descriptively the \nachievement of students on two important aspects of health and physical education not captured within the \nCritical Thinking in Health and Physical Education measure. These were students’ understanding of well-\nbeing, and movement skills. Because of rounding the percentage frequencies reported in tables in this section \nmay not always sum to 100 percent. \nPerformance on two tasks from the Critical Thinking in Health and Physical Education \nmeasure \nStudent achievement on Critical Thinking in Health and Physical Education was assessed across a number of \ntasks that have been outlined in Chapter 2. These tasks ranged in difficulty. One of the tasks that students had \na higher level of success with was a task that focused on water safety where most students were able to \nidentify risks and dangers around water and discuss what they and others can do to keep themselves safe. In \ncontrast, a task that asked students to consider issues of cheating and fair play was more challenging for them.  \nWater Safety task \nThe Water Safety task examined students’ abilities to identify risk and use safe practices in a recreational \nwater context. Students were shown photographs of a range of different water contexts and asked to choose \none that was familiar to them. They were then asked a number of questions about keeping safe and \nidentifying and managing hazards or risks. They answered in relation to the context they had chosen. The \ntask is presented in Figure 3.8. \n \n 38 Chapter 3: NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013 \n \nFigure 3.8  Water Safety task instructions \nThe percentages of Year 4 and Year 8 students responding to each question by criterion on ‘Water Safety’ \nare summarised in Tables 3.11 to 3.13 \nQ1.

At both year levels almost all students \nsuccessfully identified one or two things they could do to keep themselves safe in and around water (99 \npercent and 100 percent for Year 4 and Year 8 respectively). Year 8 students scored noticeably higher than \nYear 4 on their ability to identify two dangers/risks and explain why they posed a risk to people (42 percent \ncompared to 67 percent). Almost all students (95 percent of Year 4 compared to 98 percent of Year 8) were \nable to identify how people can manage identified dangers/risks.  \nFair Play task \nThe Fair Play task explored the construct of ‘challenges and social and cultural factors’. It examined how \ncompetition can affect people’s behaviour and the impact that competition can have on the quality of their \nexperiences. The scene for this task was set by reminding students that sometimes we see things that are \nnot right or fair when we are playing games or sports. Students were then asked a series of questions about \nwhy people might behave unfairly and whether or not cheating is acceptable. \nThey were also asked if they \nbelieved winning was important \nand if so, why they believed that. \nYear 8 students were shown \nphotographs of New Zealand \nOlympic athlete, Valerie Adams. \nThe challenges she encountered \nat the London Olympics due to \nanother athlete’s cheating were \ndescribed. They were then asked \nwhat was unfair in this scenario \nand how it might have affected \nValerie Adams. Figure 3.9 sets \nout the instructions for this task. \nThe percentages of Year 4 and \nYear 8 students responding to \neach question by criterion on \n‘Fair Play’ are summarised in \nTables 3.14 to 3.19. \n \nFigure 3.9  Fair Play task questions \nQ1.

However, far fewer students were able to give a reasoned response on whether or not \nit was okay to cheat or be unfair (18 percent and 33 percent at Year 4 and Year 8 respectively). When \nstudents were asked to identify what they could do to the make things fair in games and sports about two \nthirds of Year 4 students focused on issues at the individual level, while just over half of Year 8 students \nfocused on general or community-wide aspects. Only 15 percent of Year 4 students and 41 percent of Year \n8 students were able to provide good explanations to justify their response to the question about whether or \nnot winning was important.  \nThe majority of Year 8 students were able to describe in what ways the London Olympic Games were not \nfair for Valerie Adams: 43 percent demonstrated a good understanding of the issues. A slightly lower \nproportion of  students (37 percent) were able to provide a strong explanation of how the unfair experience \nmight affect Valerie Adams. \nWell-being task \nThe NZC identifies the concept of Hauora as being at the heart of learning in Health and Physical \nEducation. Hauora is defined as a Māori philosophy of well-being that includes four dimensions of well-\nbeing: spiritual (taha wairua), mental/emotional (taha hinengaro), social (taha whānau) and physical (taha \ntinana). Because students learn about well-being in a range of different contexts at school, it was not \npossible to create a well-being task for inclusion in the scale that would be equally accessible and relevant \nto all students.  \nStudents’ understanding of the dimensions of well-being were explored therefore through a well-being task \nthat aimed to capture the breadth of students’ conceptions of well-being, rather than act as a measure of \nlearning achievement. The instructions are set out in Figure 3.10.  \n \nFigure 3.10 Well-being task instructions \nFor the well-being task, firstly, students were told that there are lots of different kinds of things that people \ndo or have in their life that help them feel well or happy and that feeling well and happy is sometimes \ncalled well-being or hauora. Students were then asked to draw pictures or write words to show the different \nkinds of things people can do or have in their life to keep themselves feeling well and happy. Following \nthis, students were interviewed about their pictures or words and asked to explain how the aspects they had \nidentified helped to make people feel well and happy.  \n \n 42 Chapter 3: NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013 \nStudents’ responses discussed in the interview were recorded and subsequently categorised to dimensions \nof well-being using the marking guide shown in Table 3.20. This process ensured that a student’s \nwritten/drawn response was probed and discussed before being categorised. Markers were able to listen to \nto the student’s response and gain a fuller understanding of the rationale for the student’s inclusion of this \nactivity. For example, if a student listed ‘going for a walk’ as a well-being activity and when probed said it \nwas because they walk with a friend and like catching up with that friend, then in that case, the walk would \nbe categorised as primarily respresenting a ‘social’ dimension of well-being. The categorisation of \nresponses was therefore as consistent with the Hauora model as was reasonably possible, without asking \nstudents to classify their own activities. Due to the range of different contexts in which students learn about \nwell-being, an approach that asked students to classify well-being activities according to one particular \nmodel would have disadvantaged some students and was not considered appropriate.  \nTable 3.20 Marking guide used to categorise student responses to well-being task \nDimension of Well-being Example Category Examples from students’ responses \nPhysical  \nThese relate to the physical \nbody, its growth and \ndevelopment, ability to move, \nand ways of caring for the \nbody. \n1.

The \nanalysis also examined differences in conceptions of well-being between boys and girls at each year level. \nOverall, these results show that a high proportion of students at both year levels were able to identify the \nphysical, emotional, and social dimensions of well-being, in contrast to a much smaller proportion who \nidentified a spiritual dimension. Approximately 10 percent more of Year 8 students than Year 4 students \nidentified each dimension of well-being. Students were more aware of the mental/emotional dimension (83 \npercent compared to 94 percent at Year 4 and Year 8 respectively) and social dimension (72 compared to \n86 percent), than the physical dimension (60 percent compared to 70 percent). It should be noted that \n NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013: Chapter 3 43 \nbecause the question included the phrase ‘feel well and happy’ it might have primed students to consider \naspects other than the physical. Very few students (5 percent of Year 4 and 15 percent of Year 8) \nmentioned the spiritual dimension of well-being. \nBoys and girls responded similarly on some dimensions but differently on others. At Year 4, both boys and \ngirls identified the mental/emotional aspect of well-being (both 83 percent), physical (59 percent and 62 \npercent) and spiritual well-being (both 5 percent). The only gender difference of note at Year 4 was that a \nhigher percentage of girls, than boys identified the social dimension (79 percent compared to 66 percent). \nAt Year 8 boys and girls showed an equally high recognition of the mental/emotional dimension (94 \npercent). Boys were slightly more likely to identify the physical dimension (72 percent compared to 67 \npercent) and girls the social dimension (90 percent compared to 82 percent). A higher proportion of girls \nthan boys mentioned the spiritual dimension (18 percent compared to 12 percent).  \nTable 3.21 Percentage of students identifying each dimension of Well-being by year level and gender \n \nYear 4 Year 8 \n \nAll (%) Boys (%)  Girls (%) All (%) Boys (%)  Girls (%)  \nPhysical 60 59 62 70 72 67 \nMental/Emotional 83 83 83 94 94 94 \nSocial 72 66 79 86 82 90 \nSpiritual 5 5 5 15 12 18 \nMovement skills \nThe NMSSA assessment of movement skills required students to participate in a number of naturalistic \nactivities where a range of movement skills could be assessed. This approach was selected over an isolated \nassessment of particular skills such as shooting a ball through a hoop or demonstrating a static seated balance.  \nThe first game, Rippa Tag, involved two students moving within a confined space where the object of the \ngame was to catch an opponent and rip off a tag that was stuck with Velcro to the opponent’s belt. This \ngame allowed an assessment of a range of movement skills including (but not limited to) rotation, agility, \nand balance, along with strategic action skills.  \nThe second game, Rua Tapawhā (two square) involved students throwing the ball into their opponent’s \nsquare in such a way that the opponent would not be able to catch it after one bounce. The trained assessor \nacted as the opponent, providing a consistent standard of opposition for students. Students were assessed on \na range of movement skills including (but not limited to) throwing, catching, defensive tracking and \nstrategic action skills. \nThe third activity required students to create a movement sequence that included three different movement \ntypes using ropes, ribbons, tira, or hacky sacks. Students were told they should be able to repeat the \nsequence, and were asked to think about rotation, balance, different levels and speeds and moving around. \nAfter they performed the sequence, students were asked to create and perform a new movement sequence \nwith another student that modified or adapted their previous sequence and included a new movement. \nStudents were assessed on their control of the equipment, change of pace, level, and use of their bodies, as \nwell as variations in movements, use of equipment, and use of space. \nStudent performance on each task is presented separately to enable examination of differences across the \ndifferent movement skill tasks by year level, gender and school decile.  \nRippa Tag \nThe guide to scoring (Table 3.22) sets out the movement skills demonstrated by students on Rippa Tag for \nYear 4 and Year 8 students (Table 3.23 and Table 3.24). The results showed students’ movement skills \nincreasing markedly notably from Year 4 to Year 8. Almost two thirds of Year 4 students performed in the \nlow and low to mid ranges; to 40 percent of the Year 8 students performed in these ranges. Just over one third \nof Year 4 students performed in the mid to high ranges in comparison to 60 percent of Year 8 students.  \n 44 Chapter 3: NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013 \nAt both year levels boys showed a higher level of movement skill than girls, with 21 percent of the girls at \nYear 4 performing in the low range in contrast to 9 percent of the boys, and 27 percent of Year 8 boys \nperforming in the high range at year 8 in contrast to 13 percent of the girls. However, the gender difference \nbetween those scoring in the mid-high and high range was much less at Year 8 than Year 4 (a gender \ndifference of 21 percent at Year 4 and 10 percent at Year 8). \nAt Year 4 students across all decile groups achieved in a similar way with about half of students in each \ndecile achieving in the low to mid range. At Year 8 slightly more students in high decile schools than \nstudents in mid and low decile schools achieved in the mid to high range of movement skills.  \nTable 3.22 Scoring guide for Rippa Tag  \nLow Range Mid Range High Range \nShows:  \n• Uses one strategy- does not try \nsomething new when one way \ndoesn’t work  \n• Heavy on feet, flat on feet  \n• Stumbles forward to grab and \nwhen repositioning body after \nsnatch  \n• Unable or slow to change \ndirection effectively  \n• Unbalanced- perhaps feet too far \napart/base of support too wide  \n• Tires, gives up \n• Running not dodging \nAble to competently use: \n• Quick, light feet  \n• Dodge by pushing off outside \nfoot  \n• Defend the space/tag  \n• Balanced so able to transfer \nweight fluidly  \n• Re-position themselves to gain \nadvantage e.g. moves towards to \nattack/moves away from \nopposition  \n• Checking opposition \nAble to competently use: \n• Pivot  \n• Rotate body to snatch and avoid \nopposition  \n• Lower centre of gravity so able \nto change direction quickly e.g. \ncrouched position when on \nattack  \n• On balls of feet - readiness for \nmovement  \n• Quick decision making e.g. \nchange direction or speed, \nanticipation of opposition \nmoves/tactics  \n• Uses both hands \n• Consistency over defence/attack \n• Competitive/shows commitment \nTable 3.23 Year 4 Movement skills: Percentage of students scoring at each level for Rippa Tag activity by year,  \ngender and school decile \n All Year 4 Gender Decile \n All (%) Boys (%) Girls (%) Low (%) Mid (%) High (%) \nStudent displays all/almost all aspects \nfrom high range movement list 6 9 2 7 6 5 \nStudent displays a variety of aspects – \nmainly mid range with some high range \nmovements \n30 37 23 28 29 33 \nStudent displays a few aspects from mid \nrange with some low range movements 49 45 53 48 52 47 \nStudent displays low range movements 15 9 21 17 13 15 \nTable 3.24 Year 8 Movement skills: Percentage of students scoring at each level for Rippa Tag activity by year, \ngender and school decile \n All Year 8 Gender Decile \n All (%) Boys (%) Girls (%) Low (%) Mid (%) High (%) \nStudent displays all/almost all aspects \nfrom high range movement list 20 27 13 18 18 24 \nStudent displays a variety of aspects – \nmainly mid range with some high range \nmovements \n40 38 42 38 38 45 \nStudent displays a few aspects from mid \nrange with some low range movements 29 26 32 31 29 27 \nStudent displays low range movements 11 10 13 13 15 4 \n NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013: Chapter 3 45 \nRua Tapawhā  \nTables 3.25 to 3.27 provide the scoring guide for Year 4 and Year 8 students’ performance on the Rua \nTapawhā task assessing strategic action skills. As with Rippa Tag, students’ skills were considerably more \nadvanced in Year 8 thank in Year 4. Fifty-eight percent of Year 4 students performed in the low and low-\nmid range; the comparable figure at Year 8 was 25 percent. At Year 4, 41 percent of students performed in \nthe mid-high and high ranges whereas at Year 8 the figure was 75 percent.   \nThe gender differences observed in this game were greater at Year 8 than Year 4.  Although the gender \ndifference between students performing in the low range was relatively small (5 percent at Year 4 and 4 \npercent at Year 8), the gender difference between students performing in the high range was larger and \nincreased from Year 4 to Year 8 (3 percent to 20 percent). \nAt Year 4 students across all decile groups displayed a similar range of movement skills with about half of \nstudents in each decile achieving in the low to mid range. At Year 8 slightly more students in high decile \nschools displayed all/almost all aspects from the high range movement list.  \nTable 3.25 Scoring guide for ‘Rua Tapawhå’  \nLow Range Mid Range High Range \nShows: \n• Avoidance reactions: body turns \nto avoid catch, protecting face \nwith arms, closing eyes \n• Difficulty tracking the ball with \nthe eyes \n• Arms held straight out in front of \nbody \n• The body and arms, rather than \nthe hands, is used to trap the ball \n• Catching is poorly timed and \nuneven \n• Palms of the hand are face up \nand catch is more like a scoop \n• Lacks anticipation of where the \nball goes \n• Not stepping towards the ball - \nbody movement is passive until \npoint of contact \n• Off-balance \n• Heavy on feet, flat on feet \n• Unable or slow to change \ndirection effectively \nAble to competently show: \n• Feet move/body positioned in \npath/towards ball \n• One foot forward when throwing \nthe ball \n• Eyes follow flight path of the ball \n• Hands reach out to meet the ball \n• Catches and controls ball with \nhands \n• Wrist and elbows bend then \nstraighten to push the ball \n• Quick on feet \n• Hands ready \nAble to competently show: \n• Smooth transference of weight \nand force - balanced \n• Absorbs impact on catching – \nelbows and knees bend \n• Body lowered - knees flexed \n• Quick decision making e.g. \nchange in ball direction, \nanticipation of ball and \nopposition tactics \n• Defensive tracking \n• Competitive play \n• Centred mid-court position \nTable 3.26 Year 4 Strategic action skills: Percentage of students scoring at each performance level of the Rua Tapawhā \nactivity by year, gender and school decile \n All Year 4 Gender Decile \n All (%) Boys (%) Girls (%) Low (%) Mid (%) High (%) \nStudent displays all/almost all aspects from \nhigh range movement list 4 6 3 4 4 5 \nStudent displays a variety of aspects – \nmainly mid range with some high range \nmovements \n37 42 31 34 35 39 \nStudent displays a few aspects from mid \nrange with some low range movements 46 42 51 50 49 42 \nStudent displays low range movements 12 10 15 11 12 14 \n \n  \n 46 Chapter 3: NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013 \nTable 3.27 Year 8 Strategic action skills: Percentage of students scoring at each performance level of the Rua Tapawhå \nactivity by year, gender and school decile \n All Year 8 Gender Decile \n All (%) Boys (%) Girls (%) Low (%) Mid (%) High (%) \nStudent displays all/almost all aspects from \nhigh range movement list 23 33 13 23 20 27 \nStudent displays a variety of aspects – mainly \nmid range with some high range movements 52 51 53 53 53 50 \nStudent displays a few aspects from mid \nrange with some low range movements 16 9 23 17 17 14 \nStudent displays low range movements 9 7 11 7 10 9 \nMovement Sequences \nThe scoring guide for this task and results of students’ performance across the three aspects of it are set out \nin Tables 3.28 to 3.30. Students’ aggregated scores for the three aspects of the movement sequences task \nare reported. Students experienced greater success on this task than either of the other two movement skills \ntasks. Ninety percent of students at both year levels performed in the mid-high and high ranges.  \nIn contrast to the previous two tasks, gender differences were smaller and occurred in the opposite direction \nwith a greater proportion of girls than boys performing in the high range at both year levels (a difference of \n5 percent at both year levels). \nAt Year 4, more students from mid and high decile schools than students from low decile schools displayed \nhigh range of movement sequences skills (24 percent, 43 percent and 46 percent respectively). At Year 8 \nthe differences between students attending low, mid and high decile schools were more marked at the high \nrange level (39 percent, 49 percent and 59 percent, respectively).  \nTable 3.28  Scoring guide for ‘Movement Sequences’  \nMovement Sequences  \nStudents were asked to create a movement sequence independently with equipment (ropes, ribbons, tira, or \nhacky sack.  Eight elements were assessed: \n• Control of equipment \n• Change of level \n• Change of pace \n• Change of use of body parts \n• Alternate uses of equipment \n• Leg movement on the spot/body rotation \n• Variation in size of movement \n• Use of space \nStudents repeated their sequence and were also assessed on: \n• Ability to repeat the sequence showing consistency with the first display \n• Movements were controlled/defined and clearly identifiable \n• Transition between movements in the sequence was smooth  \nStudents created a new movement sequence in a pair with another student. Students were assessed on:  \n• Evidence of cooperating: each student contributed a movement \n• Evidence of sharing: both students knew what to do throughout the sequence (even if they showed \nlack of execution) \n• Evidence of re-considering the sequence from a new perspective (e.g. variety in level, pace, body parts \nused, size of movement, use of space, or introduction of a new/different movement. \n \n  \n NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013: Chapter 3 47 \nTable 3.29  Year 4 Movement sequences skills: Percentage of students scoring at each performance level for the  \nMovement Sequences activity by year, gender and school decile \n All Year 4 Gender Decile \n All (%) Boys (%) Girls (%) Low (%) Mid (%) High (%) \nHigh range: Includes 4 or more elements,  \n3 aspects of consistency, and 3 aspects of \ncooperative work \n39 37 42 24 43 46 \nMid-high range: Includes 2-3 elements, 2 aspects \nof consistency, and 2 aspects of cooperative work 51 50 51 59 48 47 \nLow-mid range: Includes at least 3 movements/ \n1 element, 1 aspect of consistency, and 1 aspect \nof cooperative work \n9 11 7 15 8 7 \nLow range: No response/don’t know, does not \ncomplete 3 movements, no evidence of \nconsistency, and no evidence of cooperative work \n1 1 0 2 1 0 \nTable 3.30  Year 8 Movement sequences skills: Percentage of students scoring at each performance level for the  \nMovement Sequences activity by year, gender and school decile \n All Year 8 Gender Decile \n All (%) Boys (%) Girls (%) Low (%) Mid (%) High (%) \nHigh range: Includes 4 or more elements,  \n3 aspects of consistency, and 3 aspects of \ncooperative work \n50 47 52 39 49 59 \nMid-high range: Includes 2-3 elements, 2 aspects \nof consistency, and 2 aspects of cooperative work 43 46 41 51 45 36 \nLow-mid range: Includes at least 3 movements/ \n1 element, 1 aspect of consistency, and 1 aspect \nof cooperative work \n6 6 6 10 6 5 \nLow range: No response/don’t know, does not \ncomplete 3 movements, no evidence of \nconsistency, and no evidence of cooperative work \n1 1 1 0 1 0 \nOverall, performance on the movement skills tasks demonstrated that students’ skills developed considerably \nfrom Year 4 to Year 8.  The gender difference on these movement skills tasks reflected the gender differences \npreviously noted for these areas (NEMP 2002 and 2006). There was some evidence of students from high \ndecile schools displaying higher levels of movement skills, strategic action skills, and particularly movement \nsequences skills than students in mid and low decile schools. This was more pronounced at Year 8 than at \nYear 4. These findings are consistent with NEMP findings from 1998, 2002 and 2006. \n 48 Chapter 4: NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013 \n4 Understanding Achievement in Health and Physical Education \nAs described in Chapter 2, the NMSSA health and physical education (PE) assessment programme used \nstudent, teacher, and principal questionnaires to collect data focused on a number of contextual factors \nassociated with understanding achievement in health and physical education. This included data related to:  \n• students’ attitudes to health and physical education; \n• students’ reported opportunities to learn health and physical education at school; \n• students’ reported frequency of and attitude to physical activity outside school; \n• the organisation of health and physical education teaching in the school, including: \n− teachers’ attitudes and confidence regarding the teaching of health and physical education  \n− teachers’ reports of the learning opportunities they provide in the classroom \n− professional support and development for teachers in health and physical education; \n• school priorities for aspects of learning areas. \nThis chapter describes how students, teachers and principals responded to the interviews and questionnaires, \nand relates the responses to patterns in achievement. Findings are reported separately for health and \nphysical education. Year 4 and Year 8 results are reported together so that comparisons between year levels \ncan be easily made. \nFor many of the tables, particularly those associated with population sub-groups, fuller tables of means, \nstandard deviations (SD), sample sizes, effect sizes and 95 percent confidence intervals can be found in \nAppendix 4. \n \n \nUnderstanding achievement in health and physical education – An overview \nStudents attitudes to health and physical education and opportunities to learn \nAttitude to Health and Attitude to Physical Education scales were developed to measure the students’ \nresponses to questions about their attitudes to these aspects of the learning area. Overall, Year 4 students \nreported more positive attitudes to health and physical education than at Year 8. The decrease in the \naverage Attitude to Physical Education score from Year 4 to Year 8 was smaller than that for Attitude to \nHealth, which was similar to that reported in NMSSA for mathematics (2013), science, and writing (2012). \nThe decline in attitude scores between Year 4 and Year 8 was smaller for boys than girls. Although average \nAttitude to Health scores for girls were higher than for boys at each year level, girls showed a greater \ndecline at Year 8. Boys and girls reported similar scores for Attitude to Physical Education at Year 4. Boys’ \nscores remained the same at Yar 8, girls’ scores declined. \n NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013: Chapter 4 49 \nOverall, the correlation between students’ attitudes and achievement in health and physical education was \nweak, although statistically significant (p<.01) for health at Year 8 and for physical education at Year 4. At \nYear 4, students in the lowest Attitude to Physical Education group achieved significantly lower than those \nin the middle and highest attitude groups.  \nOverall, most students at both year levels reported frequent opportunities to learn in health and physical \neducation. Very few students at either year level reported never having the opportunities they were asked \nabout. However, there was no discernible relationship between achievement in Critical Thinking in Health \nand Physical Education and frequency of learning opportunities in health, and only a weak relationship \nwith two learning opportunities in physical education. More frequent opportunities in PE to learn about \nsafety in movement and to use equipment for play and movement were associated with slightly higher \nachievement at both year levels.  \nStudents’ physical activities outside of school \nAbout half of all students at each year level reported being physically active outside of school nearly every \nday, with a further third of students being active 2-3 times a week. Almost half of students at both year \nlevels were able to identify fitness and health benefits of physical activity, and one in five described \nenjoyment or emotional well-being benefits.  \nSlightly more than half of all students at both year levels said they would like to do more physical activity, \nwith very few saying they would like to do less.  \nTeachers’ views of teaching health and physical education and professional support \nAt both year levels, teachers reported enjoying teaching health and physical education, and feeling \nconfident about it. Teaching confidence was higher overall than that reported for NMSSA English: writing \nor Science (2012). Teachers were supported in their teaching of physical education by a range of sources \nwith the most frequent assistance being from external providers (45 percent of teachers at Year 4 and 33 \npercent at Year 8). The use of external providers to deliver health and physical education learning is an \nissue that requires further exploration. \nMore than half of Year 8 teachers felt the professional support they received was good or excellent \ncompared to about 40 percent of Year 4 teachers. Perhaps this was related to the greater level of assistance \nfrom external providers reported by Year 8 teachers. Over two thirds of Year 4 and Year 8 teachers had \nreceived health and physical education professional development in the last two years. This compares to \njust over 80 percent in NMSSA mathematicss and statistics (2013), one third in NMSSA science (2012) \nand over 85 percent in NMSSA English: writing (2012).  Further exploration of the nature and sources of \nthis professional development may also be useful.   \nPrincipals’ views of the health and physical education learning area \nSchool principals were asked to rank in order of priority for their school 17 aspects of the learning areas of \nthe NZC. The average ranking for physical education was 7th and 8th for Year 4 and Year 8 respectively, \nand for health was 11th and 12th. Reading, writing and maths were placed in the top three at both year \nlevels. Year 4 students from schools where health and physical education was a high priority scored lower, \non average, in Critical Thinking in Health and Physical Education than those where health and physical \neducation were lower priorities. However, more low decile schools gave health and physical education a \nhigher ranking than mid or high decile schools. Differences in achievement at Year 8 by priority ranking \nwere not significant. \n \n  \n 50 Chapter 4: NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013 \n1. Year 4 and Year 8 attitudes to health and physical education  \nStudents develop important attitudes and beliefs about health and physical education and their ability as health \nand physical education learners. Sections of the NMSSA student questionnaire focused on students’ attitudes \nto learning health and their attitudes to learning physical education. This included their sense of self-efficacy \nin health and physical education and engagement as health and physical education learners. IRT scales were \ndeveloped to measure the overall strength of each student’s attitude. Attitudes scales across different learning \nareas are not directly comparable as they can have different properties (e.g. raw score standard deviations) \nthat can alter the final standardised scales. Chapter 2 describes this section of the questionnaire and the \nAttitude to Health and Attitude to Physical Education scales in more detail. Results are presented first for \nhealth and then for physical education. \nAttitude to health \nFigure 4.1 displays the distribution of scale scores on the \nAttitude to Health measure for Year 4 and Year 8 students. \nScores on average became less positive between Year 4 and \nYear 8. \nTable 4.1 shows the average Attitude to Health scale score \nand standard deviation for each year level. The average  \nscale score is 7 scale score units lower in Year 8 than Year 4. \nThis decline in the average scores represents a statistically \nsignificant effect size of -0.36 and is consistent with findings \nin other learning areas reported in other studies (for \nexample, TIMSS, 2011/12; NEMP, 1998, 2002, 2006; and \nNMSSA English: writing and Science, 2013).  \nTable 4.2 breaks down the results for girls and boys  \nat both year levels. Boys had lower average Attitude  \nto Health scores than girls in Year 4 and Year 8.  \nHowever, the difference was less at Year 8. For both girls \nand boys the difference between the Year 4 and Year 8 \naverage scores was statistically significant. \n \nFigure 4.1  Year 4 and Year 8 student scale \nscores for Attitude to Health \nGirls scored 9 scale score units lower on the scale (equivalent to an average annual effect size of -0.51), \nand boys scored 5 scale score units lower (equivalent to an average annual effect size of -0.24) at Year 8.  \nTable 4.1 Year 4 and Year 8 Attitude to Health and difference by year level \n  Year 4 Year 8 \nAverage (scale score units) 104 96 \nSD (scale score units) 21 19 \nN 2067 2066 \nDifference in average -7 \nEffect size -0.36 \nEffect sizes in bold are statistically significant (p<.05) \nTable 4.2 Year 4 and Year 8 Attitude to Health for boys and girls \n Boys Girls \n  Year 4 Year 8 Year 4 Year 8 \nAverage (scale score units) 100 95 108 98 \nSD (scale score units) 23 19 19 18 \nN 1046 1055 1021 1011 \nDifference in average -5 -9 \nEffect size -0.24 -0.51 \nEffect sizes in bold are statistically significant (p<.05) \n NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013: Chapter 4 51 \nFigures 4.2 and 4.3 display the Attitude to Health results by sub-group for Year 4 and Year 8 respectively. \nThe sub-groups shown relate to gender, ethnicity14, school decile15 and type of school16. Generally the \nspread of attitude scores for each sub-group was larger at Year 4 than at Year 8, and the median attitude \nscore for each sub-group at Year 8 was lower than that at Year 4. At Year 4, girls, Pasifika students and \nstudents attending composite schools tended to be more positive than their corresponding comparison \ngroups. At Year 8 the median scores of all sub-groups were more similar than at Year 4.  \n \nFigure 4.2 Year 4 student Attitude to Health scores by gender, ethnicity, school decile and type  \n(NZ Euro = NZ European, F.P. = Full Primary, Comp. = Composite, Cont. = Contributing) \n \nFigure 4.3 Year 8 student Attitude to Health scores by gender, ethnicity, school decile and type  \n(NZ Euro = NZ European, F.P. = Full Primary, Comp. = Composite, Int. = Intermediate) \n                                                        \n11  Non-prioritised ethnicity was used where students could identify with up to three ethnicities. This meant they could be present in multiple \nethnic groups. Student ethnicity data were obtained from student NSN information held on the Ministry of Education ENROL database. The \n‘NZ European’ category included NZ Pākehā only. The 'Pasifika' category included Tokelauan, Fijian, Niuean, Tongan, Cook Islands Māori, \nSamoan and other Pacific peoples. The 'Asian' category included Filipino, Cambodian, Vietnamese, Other Southeast Asian, Indian, Chinese, \nSri Lankan, Japanese, Korean, and other Asians. The 'Other' category included Australians, British/Irish, German, Dutch, Greek, Polish, \nSouth Slav, Italian and other Europeans.Middle Eastern, Latin American, African, and Not Stated. \n12  Low decile schools (1-3); Mid decile schools (4-7); High decile schools (8-10) \n(http://www.minedu.govt.nz/NZEducation/EducationPolicies/Schools/SchoolOperations/Resourcing/OperationalFunding/Deciles.aspx)  \n13  Full Primary (Year 1 – 8); Contributing (Year 1 – 6); Intermediate (Year 7 – 8); Composite (Year 1- 13); Secondary (Year 7-13) \n 52 Chapter 4: NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013 \nAttitude to Physical Education \nFigure 4.4 displays the distribution of scale scores \non the Attitude to Physical Education measure for \nYear 4 and Year 8 students. The decrease in average \nscores between Year 4 and Year 8 was very small \nand notably less than for Attitude to Health. \nTable 4.3 shows the average Attitude to Physical \nEducation scale score and standard deviation for \neach year level. The average scale score was 4 scale \nscore units lower in Year 8 than Year 4. This small \ndecline in the average scores represents an effect \nsize of -0.18 and is statistically significant. It is \nconsistent with the findings described above for \nother learning areas. \n \nFigure 4.4 Year 4 and Year 8 student scale scores \nfor Attitude to PE \nTable 4.3 Year 4 and Year 8 Attitude to PE and difference by year level \n  Year 4 Year 8 \nAverage (scale score units) 102 98 \nSD (scale score units) 19 21 \nN 2067 2064 \nDifference in average -4 \nEffect size -0.18 \nEffect sizes in bold are statistically significant (p<.05) \nTable 4.4 breaks down the results for girls and boys at both year levels. Boys and girls had similar average \nscores in Year 4. However girls' average score declined by 7 scale score units between Year 4 and Year 8 \n(equivalent to an average annual effect size of -0.34), while boys’ average scores for Attitude to Physical \nEducation remained at the same level.  \nTable 4.4  Year 4 and Year 8 Attitude to PE for boys and girls \n  Boys Girls \n  Year 4 Year 8 Year 4 Year 8 \nAverage (scale score units) 103 103 100 94 \nSD (scale score units) 19 20 18 21 \nN 1046 1056 1021 1008 \nDifference in average -1 -7 \nEffect size -0.03 -0.34 \nEffect sizes in bold are statistically significant (p<.05) \nFigures 4.5 and 4.6 display the Attitude to Physical Education results by sub-group for Year 4 and Year 8 \nrespectively. Unlike Attitude to Health, the spread of attitude scores for each sub-group was generally \nsimilar at Year 4 and Year 8. However, the median attitude score for each sub-group at Year 8 was lower \nthan that at Year 4 and more variable. The greatest differences between medians at Year 8 were for gender \n(boys higher than girls), ethnicity (Pasifika students higher and Asian students lower) and decile (low \ndecile group higher).  \n NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013: Chapter 4 53 \n \nFigure 4.5 Year 4 student Attitude to PE scores by gender, ethnicity, school decile and type (NZ Euro  \n=NZ European, F.P.=Full Primary, Comp. = Composite, Cont. = Contributing) \n \n  \nFigure 4.6 Year 8 student Attitude to PE scores by gender, ethnicity, school decile and type (NZ Euro= \nNZ European, F.P.=Full Primary, Comp. = Composite, Int. = Intermediate) \n  \n 54 Chapter 4: NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013 \nRelationship between attitudes to health and physical education achievement \nTable 4.5 shows the relationship between achievement in Critical Thinking in Health and Physical \nEducation and Attitude to Health and Attitude to Physical Education using the Pearson product-moment \ncorrelation coefficient (r). Overall, the relationship was relatively weak, although statistically significant \n(p<.01) for health at Year 8 and for physical education at Year 4.  \nTable 4.5  Correlations between Attitude to Health, Attitude to PE and Critical Thinking in Health and PE  \nat Year 4 and 8 \n  Attitude to Health with Critical Thinking in Health and PE (r) \nAttitude to PE with Critical \nThinking in Health and PE (r) \nYear 4 -0.02 0.11* \nYear 8 0.16* 0.04 \n* statistically significant at (p<.01) \nFigures 4.7 to 4.10 show how groups of students with lowest, middle, and highest attitude scores achieved \non the health and physical education measure at Year 4 and Year 8. To construct these graphs, three \nreporting groups were defined on the basis of the Attitudes to Health and Physical Education scale scores: \nthe lowest group of students was made up of students in the bottom quartile of scores on the Attitude to \nHealth and Attitude to Physical Education scales; the middle group represented the students who scored \nbetween the 25th and 75th percentile; and the highest group represented the students who scored in the \nupper quartile.  \nTables 4.6 and 4.7 show the differences in average scores on Critical Thinking in Health and Physical \nEducation between the three Attitude to Health and Attitude to Physical Education score groups for Year 4 \nand Year 8 students. An effect size related to each difference is also reported.  \nAlthough the relationship between attitude and achievement was weak, lowest attitude groups in both \nhealth and physical education achieved at a lower level than highest attitude the groups at Year 8, and in \nphysical education at Year 4 also. These differences could be due to the different priorities given to health \nand physical education at the different year levels, the changes in attitude between Year 4 and Year 8, or to \nother factors not considered in this study. \n  \nFigure 4.7  Year 4 student achievement scores \nby level of Attitude to Health \nFigure 4.8   Year 4 student achievement \nscores by level of Attitude to PE \n \n  \n NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013: Chapter 4 55 \nTable 4.6 Year 4 students: Differences in average achievement by level of Attitude to Health/Attitude to PE \n  Critical Thinking in Health and PE  with Attitude to Health \nCritical Thinking in Health and PE  \nwith Attitude to PE \n Difference \n(scale score units) \nEffect Size Difference \n(scale score units) \nEffect Size \nLowest/Middle 0 0.01 -7 -0.33 \nMiddle/Highest 0 -0.02 0 0.01 \nLowest/Highest 0 -0.01 -7 -0.32 \nEffect sizes in bold are statistically significant (p<.05) \n  \nFigure 4.9  Year 8 student achievement scores by \nlevel of Attitude to Health \nFigure 4.10 Year 8 student achievement scores by \nlevel of Attitude to PE \nTable 4.7 Year 8 students: Differences in average achievement by level of Attitude to Health/Attitude to PE \n  Critical Thinking in Health and PE  with Attitude to Health \nCritical Thinking in Health and PE  \nwith Attitude to PE \n  Difference (scale score units) \nEffect Size Difference \n(scale score units) \nEffect Size \nLowest/Middle -3 -0.15 -1 -0.06 \nMiddle/Highest -4 -0.20 -2 -0.08 \nLowest/Highest -7 -0.35 -3 -0.15 \nEffect sizes in bold are statistically significant (p<.05) \n  \n 56 Chapter 4: NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013 \n2. Opportunities to learn health and physical education at school \nAs part of the student questionnaire students were asked to rate how frequently they were involved in a \nrange of health and physical education learning experiences at school. The results that are presented in this \nreport are for the specific range of opportunities that students were asked about. These were broad \ncategories of opportunity and students answered using a response scale that ranged from ‘Not at all’ to \n‘Heaps’.  (See Chapter 2 for details on these statements). \nFigures 4.11 and 4.12 show how frequently students in Year 4 and Year 8 reported being involved in a \nrange of health activities. Year 4 students reported higher frequencies of learning opportunities than Year 8 \nbut with the same pattern of response. Almost 70 percent of students said that they frequently took action to \nimprove their health after learning something about health in class, and that they learned something that \nwas important to them. A smaller proportion (40 to 50 percent) reported frequently doing whole class \nactivities in health, sharing things they learned with others, and working in groups to think about and \ndiscuss things in health. Very few students at Year 4 or Year 8 (4 to 7 percent) reported never learning \nsomething that was important to them in health or never taking action to improve their health after learning \nsomething in class.  \nFigure 4.11  Frequency of health activities reported by Year 4 students \n \nFigure 4.12  Frequency of health activities reported by Year 8 students \n NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013: Chapter 4 57 \nOverall students reported a high level of learning opportunities in physical education at both year levels. \nReports by Year 4 and Year 8 students were very similar overall, suggesting that physical education \nactivities were experienced at similar frequencies at both year levels. About 80 percent of Year 4 and Year \n8 students reported frequent opportunities to learn new skills and different ways of moving; how to be safe \nwhen moving in different ways; about playing fair; working in teams or groups; and using equipment to \nplay and move around.  Year 8 students reported slightly more team or group work activities than Year 4 \nstudents. Only one to four percent of students at either year level reported never having these learning \nopportunities. About 60 percent of Year 4 and 50 percent of Year 8 students said they had frequent \nopportunities to make up movement patterns or solve movement challenges. Eight to nine percent of \nstudents at both year levels said they never had these opportunities. \n \nFigure 4.13 Frequency of PE activities reported by Year 4 students \n \nFigure 4.14 Frequency of PE activities reported by Year 8 students \n  \n 58 Chapter 4: NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013 \nRelationship between opportunities to learn and achievement in health  \nand physical education \nThe relationship between student-reported opportunities to learn and achievement in Critical Thinking in \nHealth and Physical Education was examined for each statement. Pair-wise comparisons between the scale \nscores on Critical Thinking in Health and Physical Education were made for each category of opportunities \nto learn group, and effects sizes of differences determined. (See Appendix 4).  \nThere were no statistically significant differences in achievement for any statement between students who \nreported different levels of opportunities to learn health at either year level. \nIn physical education, only small differences were observed for two statements in physical education. \nStudents at Year 4 who reported frequently ‘learning how to be safe when moving in different ways’ scored \nsignificantly higher than those who reported never receiving these opportunities. At Year 8, students who \nreported having frequent opportunities ‘to use equipment to play and move around’ achieved at a \nsignificantly higher level than those who reported having very few opportunities to do this. \nOverall, we observed a very weak relationship between the Opportunities to Learn responses and Critical \nThinking in Health and Physical Education scores. Given that we might expect to observe a stronger \nassociation between opportunities to learn and achievement scores, some possible explanations for this \ncould be:  \n• students' perception of their opportunities for learning may vary amongst students who have the \nsame opportunities; \n• the questions in the student questionnaire may not encapsulate ‘opportunities for learning in health \nand physical education’ concisely enough to render an observable result; \n• the relationship may exist, but be ‘indirect’, or have a ‘lag’, that is this year's opportunity for \nlearning in the classroom may affect next year's achievement, but not this year's.  \nThe question of the relationship between opportunities to learn in health and physical education and \nachievement in health and physical education remains open and needs further research.  \n3. Frequency of physical activity outside of school \nThe NMSSA assessment explored how much physical activity students engaged in outside of school, and \nwhat benefits students believed physical activity provides. Students were asked ‘how often do you do \nphysical activities outside of school like sport, swimming, dance, kapa haka, horse riding, skateboarding, \nbiking?’ This question encouraged a broad definition of being physically active. Students used a response \nscale of ‘nearly every day, 2-3 times a week, about once a week, or hardly ever’ to describe the frequency \nof their activity. Students were also asked what physical activities they liked doing and why it was good for \npeople to do activities like these. This information assists in building a picture of the extent to which \nstudents at these year levels understand the range of benefits of physical activity and how they have \nincorporated it into their daily lives. It provides information on the proportion of students who are rarely active \nthrough to very active. It is not intended to provide detailed assessment of those students engaging in high levels \nof physical activity. Percentage frequencies reported in tables in this section may not always sum to 100 \npercent due to rounding. \nTable 4.8 displays the percentage of boys and girls at Year 4 and Year 8 who said they were physically active \nnearly every day, 2-3 times a week, about once a week, and hardly ever. Almost half of all Year 4 students \n(46 percent) said they were active nearly every day and that percentage increased at Year 8 (52 percent). \nApproximately another third (33 percent and 37 percent at Year 4 and Year 8 respectively) were physically \nactive 2-3 times a week. Slightly more girls than boys reported being physically active nearly every day at \nYear 4, however that pattern was reversed at Year 8. Approximately one in five Year 4 students was \nphysically active about once a week or less, and this fell to approximately one in ten at Year 8. \n  \n NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013: Chapter 4 59 \nTable 4.8  Percentage of students reporting frequency of physical activity outside of school by year and gender \n Year 4 Year 8 \n All (%) Boys (%) Girls (%) All (%) Boys (%) Girls (%) \nNearly every day 46 44 49 52 55 50 \n2-3 times a week 33 33 33 37 37 38 \nAbout once a week 14 15 14 7 4 9 \nHardly ever 7 8 4 4 4 4 \nStudents were asked to name physical activities they enjoyed doing and explain why it was good for people \nto do activates like these. This question explored the extent to which students understood that physical \nactivity has benefits beyond fitness and losing weight. Student responses were categorised into eight types \nof benefits of activity, seven of which related to well-being and an ‘other’ category for non well-being-\nrelated responses. The full descriptors for each coding category are included in Table 4.9. \nTable 4.9 displays benefits of physical activity expressed by students in Years 4 and 8 and by boys and \ngirls. Boys and girls responded very similarly on all items.  \nThe most common benefit students at both year levels gave for why physical activity was good for people \nwas that it helps them stay fit and healthy (48 percent at Year 4 and 43 percent at Year 8). This was \nfollowed by just over 20 percent of the students who believed it was fun and enjoyable. Five percent of \nstudents at Year 4 and 11 percent at Year 8 described social benefits of physical activity.  \nViewed together these findings suggest that students were mostly aware of the physical health benefits of \nbeing physically active, and the enjoyment and fun to be gained from being involved. Far fewer students \ndemonstrated awareness of other well-being benefits. \nTable 4.9  Percentage of Year 4 and Year 8 student perceived benefits of physical activity \n  Year 4 Year 8 \nBenefit of Activity All (%) Boys (%) Girls (%) All (%) Boys (%) Girls (%) \nKeep fit/healthy/not be lazy/keep busy 48 49 47 43 44 42 \nFun/enjoyable/makes you feel happy \nor good 22 21 23 23 22 24 \nHaving the experience/learn new \nthings/developing skills/career 7 8 6 6 7 5 \nSocial – be with friends/family/be in a \nteam 5 5 5 11 10 12 \nBe outside/in the fresh air 4 2 5 4 4 4 \nLose weight/not get fat 3 3 2 2 3 2 \nChallenge/thrill/excitement/stepping \noutside comfort zone 1 2 1 2 2 2 \nOther (not benefit related) 10 10 10 7 8 7 \nTable 4.10 shows the percentage of boys and girls at Year 4 and Year 8 who indicated they would like to do \nmore, less, or about the same level of physical activity as they were currently doing.  Just over half of all \nstudents at both year levels (54 percent) said they would like to do more physical activity, and just under half \n(43 and 44 percent) said they would like to do about the same. Very few said they would like to do less.  \n  \n 60 Chapter 4: NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013 \nTable 4.10  Percentage of Year 4 and Year 8 students who would like to do a different amount of physical  \nactivity by year and gender \n \nYear 4 Year 8 \n \nAll (%) Boys (%) Girls (%) All (%) Boys (%) Girls (%) \nMore 54 50 59 54 52 56 \nAbout the same 43 45 39 44 46 41 \nLess 3 5 1 2 2 2 \nStudents who said that they would like to do more physical activity were asked if they could identify ‘any \nthings that make it hard for you to do more?’ Barriers to doing more physical activity were recorded during \ninterviews and coded into categories of health, access, financial, busy with other things, and family \ncircumstances. Table 4.11 displays the numbers of students who responded to this question, and the \npercentages of boys and girls at Year 4 and Year 8 who responded in these categories.  Although over  \n50 percent of students at each year level said they would like to do more physical activity, at Year 4 only \n13 percent were able to identify specific barriers to activity. At Year 8, that proportion doubled.  \nThe most common barrier to more frequent physical activity was students being busy with other things  \n(46 percent at each year), followed by health reasons (29 percent at year 4 compared to 22 percent at Year \n8), and family circumstances (18 percent compared to 13 percent). Access and financial issues were \nregarded as barriers by a very small percentage of students. Gender differences were small and different at \neach year level. At Year 4, boys were more likely to cite family circumstances as a barrier (23 percent \ncompared to 16 percent) while girls were more likely to describe being busy with other things as a barrier \n(49 percent compared to 40 percent). At Year 8, this pattern had changed with more girls citing family \ncircumstances (16 percent compared to 11 percent) and more boys citing health issues as a barrier  \n26 percent compared to 18 percent). \nTable 4.11  Percentage of students identifying types of barriers to do doing more physical activity outside of school by \nyear and gender \n \nYear 4 Year 8 \n \nAll (%) Boys (%) Girls (%) All (%) Boys (%) Girls (%) \nHealth 29 30 29 22 26 18 \nAccess 2 3 2 14 14 15 \nFinancial 5 5 5 5 4 6 \nBusy with other things 46 40 49 46 45 46 \nFamily Circumstances 18 23 16 13 11 16 \n4. Teaching health and physical education at Year 4 and Year 8 \nUp to three teachers per school were asked to complete a questionnaire about the teaching of health and \nphysical education at Year 4 or Year 8. Where one existed, the specialist teacher of health and/or physical \neducation completed one of the questionnaires. At Year 4, 176 teachers completed the questionnaire (this \nincluded 6 specialists) and at Year 8 the number was 186 (including 16 specialists). This group of teachers \nis not nationally representative, but there were the teachers of the nationally representative sample of \nstudents that participated in NMSSA. \nTeacher attitudes and confidence in teaching health and physical education  \nTeachers were asked to respond to statements such as ‘I personally enjoy the learning area of Health’ and ‘I \nfeel confident about teaching Health’ using a 4-point response scale that indicated whether the statement was \n‘Not at all true for me’, ‘Slightly true for me’, ‘Moderately true for me’, or ‘Very true for me’. Figures 4.15 \nand 4.16 report the findings for health, and Figures 4.17 and 4.18 report the findings for physical education. \n NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013: Chapter 4 61 \nHealth \nOverall, at both year levels, teachers responded positively regarding their enjoyment of health, how much \nthey liked teaching it, and their confidence to teach it. Over 80 percent of teachers reported that it was \n‘moderately’ or ‘very true for them’ that they were confident in responding to difficult questions from \nstudents, were able to adjust lessons as appropriate to respond to the needs of individual students, were able \nto teach a diverse range of students, and were able to draw on students’ backgrounds and experiences to \nsupport their learning. \n   \nFigure 4.15  Year 4: Distribution of teachers’ attitude to teaching health  \n   \nFigure 4.16 Year 8: Distribution of teachers’ attitude to teaching health \n \n  \n 62 Chapter 4: NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013 \nPhysical education \nTeachers’ reports of their attitudes to teaching physical education were similarly very positive. Over 80 \npercent of teachers endorsed all of the items as ‘moderately’ or ‘very true for them’. Statements related to \ntheir enjoyment and confidence in teaching physical education, their ability to respond to difficult questions, \nto tailor teaching to individual needs, to motivate students with low interest, and their skills to teach a diverse \nrange of students.  \n \nFigure 4.17  Year 4: Distribution of teachers’ attitude to teaching PE \n   \nFigure 4.18  Year 8: Distribution of teachers’ attitude to teaching PE \n \n  \n NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013: Chapter 4 63 \nHealth and physical education activities provided by teachers in the classroom \nTeachers were asked to report how frequently students in their class were involved in a range of activities \nto learn health. Their responses are displayed in Figure 4.19 for Year 4 and Figure 4.20 for Year 8.  \nAt both year levels, the most frequently reported opportunities teachers provided for students to learn in \nhealth were taking part in whole class activities and working in groups to discuss topics in health. Fifty to \n60 percent of Year 4 teachers reported these activities happening once a week or more often for their class.  \nAt Year 8, these figures were higher at about 70 percent.  \nForty percent of Year 4 teachers reported, that once a week or more frequently, students shared things they \nhad learned in health with others and studied topics connected to their cultural or community knowledge.  \nAt Year 8, more teachers reported students sharing things they had learned with others on a weekly or more \nfrequent basis, but slightly fewer teachers reported studying topics, weekly or more often, that related to \nstudents’ cultural knowledge.  \nLess frequent activities included taking part in whole school activities to learn about health, and accessing \nhealth education from experts or visitors to the classroom. About 75 to 85 percent of teachers at both year \nlevels reported these activities occurring about once a month or less frequently. \n \nFigure 4.19  Year 4: Percentage of teachers proving different opportunities for students to \nlearn health \n 64 Chapter 4: NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013 \n \nFigure 4.20 Year 8: Percentage of teachers proving different opportunities for students to \nlearn health \nFigures 4.21 and 4.22 present the teachers’ responses for frequency of learning opportunities in physical \neducation at Year 4 and Year 8.  Results were broadly similar for Year 4 and Year 8. According to \nteachers’ reports, the activities that students most often experienced were playing games, using equipment \nto move around, learning different ways to be active, working in teams or groups, playing sports, and \ntaking part in fitness activities. Students had fewer opportunities to study topics related to their cultural \nknowledge or make up movement patterns. Having visiting experts in the classroom was the least frequent \nactivity, happening once a month or less for more than 80 percent of teachers. \n \nFigure 4.21 Year 4: Percentage of teachers providing different opportunities for students to \nlearn PE  \n NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013: Chapter 4 65 \n   \nFigure 4.22 Year 8: Percentage of teachers providing different opportunities for students \nto learn PE  \nA greater percentage of Year 8 (40 percent) than Year 4 teachers (30 percent) reported having experts visit \ntheir classroom about once a month. At Year 4 almost 60 percent of teachers reported students having \nfitness activities 4-5 days per week. At Year 8 that had fallen to less than 40 percent with a larger group \nreporting students had fitness 2-3 days per week. Overall however, teachers reported that students \nparticipated frequently in a range of physical education activities. \nComparing student and teacher perceptions of opportunities to learn \nStudents and teachers were asked some parallel questions about the frequency of some classroom activities \nrelated to health and physical education, although the wording was slightly different in the two \nquestionnaires. Tables 4.12 and 4.13 show the percentages of students and teachers at each year level who \nreported high frequency (once a week or more for teachers, and ‘quite a lot’ or ‘heaps’ for students) of \nactivities listed in the parallel questions.  \nOverall, teachers reported higher frequencies of comparable activities in health than students. The biggest \ndifference at each year level was that teachers reported a greater frequency of whole class learning \nactivities than students. This may be due in part to the more qualified wording of the student statement that \nsaid ‘my whole class does things that help me learn about health’. Differences between student and teacher \nresponses were more pronounced at Year 8 than Year 4.  \nIn physical education, student and teacher reports were very similar on most parallel items. However, \nstudents at each year level rated themselves as having more frequent opportunities than teachers did to \nmake up movement patterns and solve problems. This could be due to differences in perception or \nclassification of what these activities mean. At each year level a smaller proportion of students than \nteachers reported frequent opportunities in physical education to use equipment to play and move.  \n  \n 66 Chapter 4: NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013 \nTable 4.12 Comparison of student and teacher reports of frequent activities in health \nStudents (%) Teachers (%) \nMy whole class does things that \nhelp me learn about health \nYear 4 45 Take part in whole class activities \nto learn about health \nYear 4 64 \nYear 8 32 Year 8 74 \nShare things I've learned about \nhealth with others \nYear 4 49 Share things they have learned \nabout in health with others \nYear 4 40 \nYear 8 31 Year 8 51 \nWork in groups to think about \nand discuss things in health \nYear 4 43 Work in groups to discuss topics \nin health \nYear 4 54 \nYear 8 45 Year 8 71 \nTable 4.13 Comparison of student and teacher reports of frequent activities in PE \nStudents (%) Teachers (%) \nLearn new skills and different \nways of moving \nYear 4 83 \nLearn new skills \nYear 4 75 \nYear 8 80 Year 8 80 \nLearn how to be safe when I am \nmoving in different ways \nYear 4 80 Learn how to be safe when \nmoving in different ways \nYear 4 75 \nYear 8 73 Year 8 76 \nWork in teams or groups \nYear 4 80 \nWork in teams or groups \nYear 4 95 \nYear 8 92 Year 8 98 \nHave challenges like making up \nmovement patterns or solving \nproblems \nYear 4 64 \nMake up movement patterns \nYear 4 38 \nYear 8 50 Year 8 26 \nUse equipment to play and move \naround \nYear 4 79 Use equipment to play and move \naround \nYear 4 99 \nYear 8 82 Year 8 99 \nMeeting the differentiated needs of students in health and physical education \nTeachers were asked about the strategies they used to meet the differentiated needs of their students in \nhealth and physical education. The pattern of their responses, shown in Figure 4.23, was similar at Year 4 \nand Year 8. Whole class activities were the most commonly used strategy (about 80 percent), followed by \ndifferent ability level groups within the classroom (almost 60 percent), and different topic or interest groups \n(about 40 percent). A smaller proportion of teachers reported incorporating community events as a context \nfor learning or receiving specialist advice to adapt the curriculum for learners with special education needs. \n \nFigure 4.23 Percentage of Year 4 and Year 8 teachers who use techniques to meet the \ndifferentiated needs of students for health and PE \n NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013: Chapter 4 67 \nProfessional support and development for teachers in health and physical education  \nTeachers were asked about the sources of assistance they received in the classroom with their teaching of \nhealth and physical education. Figure 4.24 shows teachers’ responses for each type of support. Support in \nthe classroom was received from a wide variety of sources with external providers making up the largest \nsource at both year levels. Forty-five percent of teachers at Year 4 and more than 30 percent at Year 8 \nreported that external providers helped with health and/or physical education. Given the widespread use of \nexternal providers in the classroom for health and physical education, further exploration of the areas of \nlearning they deliver and how this learning is assessed may be useful. This is reinforced by the conclusion \nof Dyson, Gordon and Cowan (2011) 17  that the use of external providers for teaching health, and \nparticularly physical education, is now ‘ubiquitous in our primary schools’ and these programmes need to \nbe evaluated carefully for their learning intentions and outcomes in relation to the health and physical \neducation learning area of the NZC. \n \nFigure 4.24 Percentage of teachers receiving types of classroom support for teaching health  \nand/or PE by year \nFigure 4.25 displays teachers’ reports of the level of support they receive from their school in relation to \nthe teaching of health and physical education.  Overall, Year 8 teachers reported higher satisfaction than \nYear 4 teachers with the professional support they receive. Almost 55 percent of Year 8 teachers rated their \nsupport as good or excellent in comparison to Year 4 teachers where the figure was 40 percent. No Year 4 \nteachers reported their support as poor, however about 5 percent of Year 8 teachers did. \n \n \nFigure 4.25 Distribution of the level of professional support teachers report getting in HPE \n                                                        \n17  Dyson, B., & Gordon, B., & Cowan (2011) What is physical education in primary schools in Aotearoa/New Zealand? Asia-Pacific \nJournal of Health, Sport and Physical Education, 2:3-4, 5-16 \n 68 Chapter 4: NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013 \nFigure 4.26 displays how recently Year 4 and Year 8 teachers reported receiving health and physical \neducation professional learning and development (PLD). The figure shows that about 70 percent of Year 4 \nand Year 8 teachers had received health and physical education PLD in the last two years. This compares to \njust over 80 percent of mathematics and statistics teachers (NMSSA, 2013), 30 percent of science teachers \n(NMSSA, 2012), and over 85 percent in English: writing (NMSSA, 2012). About 60 percent of Year 4 and \nYear 8 teachers had PLD in the past 12 months, and about 5 percent or fewer teachers at each year level \nreported never having received health and physical education PLD.  \n   \nFigure 4.26 Percent of teachers reporting PLD opportunities in health and PE in  \nthe past five years  \n5. The place of health and physical education in the overall teaching \nprogramme \nSchool principals at Year 4 and Year 8 were asked to rank 17 aspects of the NZC learning areas in order of \nthe priority placed on each aspect in their school. The average ranking for each aspect assigned by all \nprincipals who responded to this question are shown in Tables 4.14 and 4.15. Reading, writing and maths \nwere placed in the top three at both year levels. Physical education ranked 7th and 8th for Year 4 and Year \n8 respectively, and health ranked 11th and 12th respectively.  \nTable 4.14 Priority ranking of 17 aspects of learning areas by principals at Year 4 \nRank Aspect N Minimum Maximum Mean \n1 Reading 79 1 5 1.7 \n2 Writing 78 1 6 1.7 \n3 Mathematics and statistics 79 1 11 2.1 \n4 Speaking 76 1 15 4.7 \n5 Listening 75 1 16 5.6 \n6 Presenting 73 1 17 7.5 \n7 PE 75 3 15 8.1 \n8 Science 76 1 16 8.1 \n9 Viewing 73 1 17 8.3 \n10 Social Studies 75 3 16 9.2 \n11 Health 75 1 16 9.9 \n12 Technology 76 1 17 10.3 \n13 Visual Arts 73 4 15 10.4 \n14 Music 74 2 17 10.6 \n15 Drama 75 4 17 12.7 \n16 Dance 75 4 17 13.1 \n17 Language 72 4 17 14.6 \n \n \n NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013: Chapter 4 69 \nTable 4.15 Priority ranking of 17 aspects of learning areas by principals at Year 8 \nRank Aspect N Minimum Maximum Mean \n1 Writing 69 1 7 1.5 \n2 Reading 67 1 13 1.9 \n3 Mathematics and statistics 71 1 7 2.2 \n4 Speaking 67 1 16 5.4 \n5 Listening 68 1 16 5.9 \n6 Presenting 68 1 16 6.6 \n7 Science 70 1 16 6.9 \n8 PE 70 1 15 7.7 \n9 Viewing 67 1 17 7.8 \n10 Social Studies 69 1 17 8.5 \n11 Technology 70 2 17 8.9 \n12 Health 68 3 17 9.7 \n13 Visual Arts 66 3 17 10.4 \n14 Music 67 1 16 10.8 \n15 Drama 66 2 17 12.1 \n16 Dance 68 3 17 12.5 \n17 Language 67 3 17 12.8 \n \nFigure 4.27 shows the involvement of a range of groups in setting a school’s curriculum priorities. It \ndisplays the percentages of principals who reported involving their syndicate or curriculum committee, \nBoard of Trustees, community, students, community or cultural experts in their curriculum planning. \nPrincipals were able to select multiple responses and so totals do not sum to 100 percent. Almost 25 \npercent of principals indicated that they involved others: most often these included the \nsyndicate/curriculum committee, the Board of Trustees and slightly less often, the community and students.  \n \nFigure 4.27  Principals reports of groups involved in setting curriculum priorities \n 70 Chapter 4: NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013 \nThe relationship between curriculum priority and student achievement \nThe relationship between a school’s priority ranking for health and physical education and student \nachievement on the measure of Critical Thinking in Health and Physical Education was examined. At Year 4, \nachievement was negatively correlated with a higher priority ranking for health (r = -.23; p <.000) and for \nphysical education (r = -.20; p<.000). At Year 8, there was no statistically significant correlation between \neither health or physical education and student achievement. Examination of the decile profile of high and low \npriority groups, explored in the following sections, may provide some explanation of these results. \nTables 4.16 and 4.17 display the average achievement scores for Critical Thinking in Health and Physical \nEducation for Year 4 and Year 8 students according to the priority ranking reported by their school \nprincipal for health and physical education respectively. A high ranking group included students from \nschools where the learning areas aspects i.e. (health or physical education) was ranked in the first 5 \nlearning areas, a middle group where it ranked 6th to 12th, and a low ranking group where the learning area \naspect was ranked at 13th priority or lower. The results show that for both health and physical education, \nstudents at Year 4 schools where health or physical education was a high priority scored, on average, lower \nthan students at those schools where health or physical education was a mid or low priority. There was no \nsignificant difference in achievement at Year 8 between students from schools that ranked health or \nphysical education as a high or low priority. \nTable 4.16 Year 4 and Year 8 student achievement by health priority ranking by school \n \nYear 4 Year 8 \nCurriculum Priority/ranking  High (1-5) \nMiddle \n(6-12) \nLow \n(13-17) \nHigh \n(1-5) \nMiddle \n(6-12) \nLow \n(13-17) \nAverage Critical Thinking in Health \nand PE score (scale score units) 73 89 93 112 111 113 \nN 54 364 161 76 334 114 \nTable 4.17 Year 4 and Year 8 student achievement by PE priority ranking by school  \n \nYear 4 Year 8 \nCurriculum Priority/ranking  High (1-5) \nMiddle \n(6-12) \nLow \n(13-17) \nHigh \n(1-5) \nMiddle \n(6-12) \nLow \n(13-17) \nAverage (scale score units) 81 90 93 111 111 108 \nN 113 419 47 162 331 47 \nExploration of the decile ranking of schools in the high and low health and physical education priority \ngroups may provide some explanation for the above results. Figures 4.28 and 4.29 present the breakdown \nof Year 4 and Year 8 students by high, middle and low priority groups for health and physical education \nrespectively, and display the percent of students by school decile in each priority group.  \nAt Year 4, the group of students whose schools ranked health or physical education as a high priority \ncontained greater proportions of students from low decile schools than mid or high decile schools. \nConversely, the group of students whose schools ranked health as a low priority was made up of a greater \nproportion of high and mid decile school students. This pattern was more pronounced for physical \neducation: there were no students from low decile schools in the low priority group. NMSSA results for \nCritical Thinking in Health and Physical Education, described in Chapter 3, have shown that achievement \ndifferences by school decile group are significant, with higher achievement by high decile school groups. \nAt Year 8, the priority rankings assigned to health by schools were more similar across the decile groups than \nat Year 4. Assigning a higher priority to health did not result in higher achievement on average, for students at \nYear 8.  In physical education, although the priorities were more similar by decile group at Year 8, very few   \n NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013: Chapter 4 71 \nhigh decile schools ranked physical education as a high or a low priority. Students in the low priority \nphysical education group came mainly from low and mid decile schools and scored slightly lower on \naverage than the other two priority groups.  The difference in average scores may be due to the difference \nin composition by school decile. \nThere was a tendency at Year 4, amongst the low decile schools in this sample, to place a higher priority on \nhealth and physical education than was the case among high decile schools. Generally, the reasons for these \ndifferences in priority for health and physical education by decile group and their implications for \nachievement across the learning areas deserve further consideration, but are possibly related to current \nMinistry of Education curriculum priorities for raising achievement in reading, writing and mathematics \nacross the curriculum. \n \nFigure 4.28  Year 4 and Year 8: Percentage of students in each decile group by health \npriority ranking \n \nFigure 4.29  Year 4 and Year 8: Percentage of students in each decile group by PE priority \nranking \n \n 72 Chapter 5: NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013 \n5 Māori Student Achievement in Health  and Physical Education \nThis chapter presents the findings for Māori18 student achievement in health and physical education (PE) at \nYear 4 and Year 8. It looks at the variation of achievement within year levels and presents results against \nthe levels of the NZC. It examines the difference in achievement between Year 4 and Year 8, and \ndifferences between sub-groups of gender, school decile and type of school. The chapter presents a profile \nof Māori students who scored above the benchmark of the national average at Year 4 and Year 8 with \nrespect to gender, school decile, attitudes and opportunities to learn health and physical education. It also \nprovides information on Māori students’ understanding of well-being, demonstration of movement skills, \nand frequency of physical activity outside of school. \nIn this chapter, we compare the Māori student sub-group to all students in the national sample. When \nmaking these comparisons the national sample will be referred to as ‘All Students’. \nFor some of the tables used in this chapter, particularly those associated with population sub-groups, fuller \ntables of averages, standard deviations, sample sizes, effect sizes, and 95 percent confidence intervals can \nbe found in Appendix 4.  \n  \n                                                        \n18 Students could identify with up to three ethnic groups. All students who identified as Māori were included in these analyses \n NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013: Chapter 5 73 \nSuccess and achievement of Māori students in health and physical education \n– An overview \nAchievement in health and physical education \nGenerally Year 4 and Year 8 Māori students achieved at a lower level than NZ European students. \nHowever, many features of Māori student achievement followed similar patterns to the national samples.  \nThe average achievement in Critical Thinking in Health and Physical Education was lower for Māori \nstudents from low decile schools but similar for Māori boys and girls, and for Māori students attending \ndifferent types of schools. This was similar to the finding for the All Students group. \nMāori students made similar progress between Year 4 and Year 8 as All Students. \nThe majority of Māori and NZ European students described well-being categorised as mental/emotional \n(taha hinengaro), social (taha whānau) and physical (taha tinana) dimensions of well-being. Understanding \nof well-being increased from Year 4 to Year 8 with the greatest differences being for the mental/emotional \nand social dimensions for Māori students. At both year levels very few students mentioned the spiritual \nspiritual (taha wairua) dimension of well-being.  \nMāori students’ movement skills developed considerably from Year 4 to Year 8 showing a similar increase \nfor All Students. At each year level, slightly more boys performed higher than girls on movement skills, \nand strategic action skills, but there were no gender differences on the movement sequences task. \nAchievement against curriculum levels  \nStudents’ peformance on the Critical Thinking for Health and Physical Education measure was aligned to \nthe curriculum levels in health and physical education. Ninety-four percent of Year 4 Māori students were \nachieving at Level 2 or above. This was similar to All Students and exceeds the expectations expressed in \nthe NZC for health and physical education for Year 4 students. Forty-one percent of the Year 8 Māori \nstudents were achieving at Level 4 or above. This was lower than the proportion of All Students at Year 8 \nachieving at that level. Overall Year 8 students were achieving below curriculum expectations.  \nPhysical activities outside of school \nApproximately half of Māori students engaged in physical activities outside of school at Year 4 and Year 8 \nalmost every day with Year 8 Māori students being engaged in physical activities more frequently than \nYear 4 students. A similar pattern was observed for NZ European students. About half of Year 4 Māori \nstudents and slightly more (about 60 percent) of Year 8 Māori students would like to do more physical \nactivities outside of school.  \nBenchmarking Māori success \nThe national averages at Year 4 and Year 8 were used as the benchmarks for the respective year levels. \nApproximately 40 percent of Māori students scored above the benchmark on the Critical Thinking in \nHealth and Physical Education measure at Year 4 and Year 8. The characteristics of Māori students at each \nyear level who scored above the benchmark for their year level were explored and contrasted with a \nsimilarly sized group of students who scored below the benchmark. \nMāori students in the above benchmark group at Year 4 reported having more frequent opportunities to \ntake action to improve their health after learning something in class, and at Year 8 students reported more \nfrequent opportunities to learn something in health that was important to them. In general there was little \ndifference in the pattern of responses for students above the benchmark compared with those below the \nbenchmark with respect to opportunities to learn physical education.  \nThe interaction between decile and ethnicity \nAt each year level, a greater proportion of Māori students at high decile schools achieved above the \nbenchmark than Māori students from mid and low decile schools. A study of how decile and ethnicity related \nto achievement in Critical Thinking in Health and Physical Education indicated that decile is strongly \nassociated with achievement on this scale. Average health and physical education scores increased with \ndecile. In addition, there was an effect due to ethnicity which remained after accounting for the decile effect. \n 74 Chapter 5: NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013 \n1. Year 4 Māori student achievement in health and physical education \nTable 5.1 shows how Māori students in Year 4 performed on the NMSSA Critical Thinking in Health and \nPhysical Education scale. It provides the average scale score along with standard deviation and sample size.  \nTable 5.1 Year 4 Māori student overall achievement in Critical Thinking in  \nHealth and PE \n  Critical Thinking in Health and PE \nAverage (scale score units) 83 \nSD (scale score units) 20 \nN 162 \nAt Year 4 the average score for Māori students on the health and physical education measure was 83 scale \nscore units. This was lower than that for All Students (89 scale score units) with the same amount of \nvariation. Refer to Chapter 2 for details of the health and physical education descriptions that identify what \nYear 4 Māori students know and can do at this level. \nA curriculum alignment exercise was undertaken to link performance ranges on the NMSSA health and \nphysical education to the NZC (Appendix 3). Creating this link allowed scale scores for this measure to be \nreported in terms of curriculum expectations. It should be noted that the scale assesses a subset of the learning \nobjectives covered by the health and physical education learning area. A number of other aspects of the \nlearning area, e.g. understanding of well-being and movement skills were assessed and reported on separately. \nTable 5.2 sets out the percentage of Year 4 Māori students who scored in each curriculum level for health and \nphysical education. Ninety-four percent of Year 4 Māori students achieved at Level 2 or above as did All \nStudents. This represents the expected level of performance for Year 4 students at the end of the year and \nindicates that almost all students are exceeding the curriculum expectations in the domains assessed.  \nTable 5.2 Percentage of Year 4 Māori students and All Students achieving at the NZC  \nhealth and PE level 2  \n Critical Thinking in Health and PE \n Māori students (%) All Students (%) \nLevel 2 or above 94 97 \nNot yet Level 2 6 3 \n \n2.

This was lower than that for All Students (111 scale score \nunits) with slightly less variation in the scores. Refer to Chapter 2 for details of the health and physical \neducation descriptions that identify what Year 8 Māori students know and can do at this level. \nTable 5.4 shows how Year 8 Māori students performed against the NZC levels on the Critical Thinking in \nHealth and Physical Education measure. Just over 41 percent of Māori students achieved at Level 4 and above \ncompared to just over half of All Students. The Level 4 and above band represents the performance expectation \nfor Year 8 students. Generally, Year 8 students were achieving below the curriculum expectations. \nTable 5.4 Percentage of Year 8 Māori students and All Students achieving at the NZC health  \nand PE level 4 \n Critical Thinking in Health and PE \n Māori students (%) All Students (%) \nLevel 4 or above 41 51 \nNot yet Level 4 59 49 \n3. Comparison of Year 4 and Year 8 Māori student achievement   \nFigure 5.1 shows the distribution of Year 4 and Year 8 Māori students on the Critical Thinking in Health \nand Physical Education scale. As expected, Year 8 Māori students achieved, on average, higher scores than \nYear 4 students. As with All Students, there was a wide variation in scores at each year level, and some \noverlap in the achievement of Year 4 and Year 8 Māori students. \n \nFigure 5.1  Māori student achievement for Critical \nThinking in Health and PE by year level \n \n  \n 76 Chapter 5: NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013 \nFigures 5.2 and 5.3 illustrate the spread of achievement across the NZC levels for Year 4 and Year 8 Māori \nstudents on the Critical Thinking in Health and Physical Education measure. The blurred lines around the \ncut-off scores dividing the curriculum levels reflect the fact that these boundaries may not be precise.  \nThe figures show that most Year 4 Māori students were achieving at least in the Level 2 performance range or \nhigher and that most of Year 8 Māori students were achieving at Level 3 or above. The proportion of Year 8 \nMāori students achieving at this level was lower than the proportion of All Students at Year 8 achieving it. \n \n \n  \nFigure 5.2 Distribution of Year 4 Māori student \nachievement on Critical Thinking in \nHealth and PE against levels of the \nNZC health and PE \n Figure 5.3 Distribution of Year 8 Māori student \nachievement on Critical Thinking in \nHealth and PE against levels of the \nNZC health and PE \nTable 5.5 shows the differences in average scores between Year 4 and Year 8 Māori students expressed in \nscale score units and effect sizes, and the average, standard deviation and sample size for each year level \nfor the Critical Thinking in Health and Physical Education scale.  \nThe Māori student average scores were lower than those of All Students at both year levels (See Chapter 3). \nHowever, the scale score unit difference (ssud) between the Year 4 and Year 8 average for Māori students \nwas 25 and for All Students it was 23.

Thus Māori students’ progress for all sub-groups was similar to that for All Students. \nTable 5.7 Differences in Critical Thinking in Health and Physical Education measure between Year 4 and Year 8 Māori \nstudents by sub-group  \n Critical Thinking in Health and PE \n Year 4 average \n(scale score units) \nYear 8 average \n(scale score units) \nDifference*  \n(scale score units) \nEffect Size Average Annual \nEffect Size \nGender      \nBoys  82 108 26 1.42 0.35 \nGirls  84 107 24 1.27 0.32 \nSchool Decile           \nLow  77 104 27 1.46 0.36 \nMid  86 108 21 1.22 0.31 \nHigh  91 117 26 1.54 0.38 \nDifference = Year 8 – Year 4.  \nEffect sizes in bold are statistically significant (p<.05) \nThe scale score differences have been calculated using non-rounded numbers, and are numerically correct.

Māori students’ understanding of well-being, movement skills  \nand reported physical activity \nWell-being \nAs explained in Chapter 3 the NZC identifies the concept of Hauora as being at the heart of learning in health \nand physical education. Hauora is defined as a Māori philosophy of well-being that includes four dimensions: \nspiritual (taha wairua), mental/emotional (taha hinengaro), social (taha whānau) and physical (taha tinana). \nStudents were told there are lots of different kinds of things that people do or have in their life to help them \nfeel well or happy. They were asked to draw pictures or write words to show the things that people do or have \nto help keep them well or happy.  They discussed the pictures with an interviewer. Interviews were analysed \nand elements of well-being identified were categorised into the different dimensions of well-being. Note that \npercentage frequencies reported in tables in this section may not always sum to 100 percent due to rounding. \nTable 5.8 displays the percentage of Māori students at Year 4 and Year 8 whose responses were categorised \ninto each of the four dimensions of well-being, alongside those for NZ European students. See Table 3.20, \nChapter 3 for the examples of how student responses were categorised. \nTable 5.8 Percentage of Māori and NZ European students identifying dimensions of Well-being by year level  \n \nYear 4 Year 8 \n \nMāori (%) \nN = 162 \nNZE (%) \nN = 481 \nMāori (%) \nN = 190 \nNZE (%) \nN = 457 \nPhysical 63 63 72 72 \nMental/Emotional 78 85 93 93 \nSocial 70 71 85 86 \nSpiritual 7 4 16 13 \nMāori and NZ European students responded similarly on all but two dimensions. At Year 4, a slightly smaller \nproportion of Māori students mentioned the mental/emotional dimension than NZ Europeans (78 percent \ncompared to 85 percent). At both year levels very few students’ responses related to the spiritual dimension of \nwell-being, although there was a slightly higher proportion of Māori students than All Students.  \n 80 Chapter 5: NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013 \nOverall more Year 8 students’ than Year 4 students’ descriptions of well-being related to each dimension of \nwell-being with the greatest differences being for the mental/emotional and social dimensions.  \nMovement skills \nThe following tables display the percentage of Māori students by gender who scored in the different ranges \nof movement skills on three tasks: Rippa Tag (Table 5.9 and 5.10), Rua Tapawhā (Table 5.11 and 5.12), \nand Movement Sequences (Table 5.13 and 5.14). Refer to Chapter 3 for the description of the tasks and \nskills assessed, the scoring guide for each task and the findings for All Students. \nYear 4 Māori students generally demonstrated low to mid range skills in movement skills, and strategic \naction skills. However, they demonstrated mid to high level movement sequences skills. Year 8 Māori \nstudents generally demonstrated mid to high range skills in all areas, and mid-high to high movement \nsequences skills. At both year levels slightly more boys than girls demonstrated higher levels of movement \nskills and strategic action skills. Students at both year levels showed stronger skills (mid-high to high \nrange) in movement sequences with no difference between boys and girls. The pattern of responses was \nsimilar to that for All Students on the three movement skill tasks. \nTable 5.9 Māori Year 4 Movement skills: Percentage of students scoring at each level for ‘Rippa Tag’ activity  \nby year and gender \n Māori students \n All (%) Boys (%) Girls (%) \nStudent displays all/almost all aspects from high range \nmovement list 9 11 6 \nStudent displays a variety of aspects – mainly mid range with \nsome high range movements 31 39 22 \nStudent displays a few aspects from mid range with some low \nrange movements 46 46 45 \nStudent displays low range movements 14 3 26 \nTable 5.10 Māori Year 8 Movement skills: Percentage of students scoring at each level for ‘Rippa Tag’ activity  \nby year and gender \n Māori students \n All (%) Boys (%) Girls (%) \nStudent displays all/almost all aspects from high range \nmovement list 16 22 10 \nStudent displays a variety of aspects – mainly mid range with \nsome high range movements 47 43 52 \nStudent displays a few aspects from mid range with some low \nrange movements 24 23 24 \nStudent displays low range movements 13 12 13 \nTable 5.11 Māori Year 4 Strategic action skills: Percentage of students scoring at each level for ‘Rua Tapawhā’  \nactivity by year and gender \n Māori students \n All (%) Boys (%) Girls (%) \nStudent displays all/almost all aspects from high range \nmovement list 5 5 5 \nStudent displays a variety of aspects – mainly mid range with \nsome high range movements 40 46 32 \nStudent displays a few aspects from mid range with some low \nrange movements 46 44 49 \nStudent displays low range movements 9 6 13 \n NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013: Chapter 5 81 \nTable 5.12 Māori Year 8 Strategic action skills: Percentage of students scoring at each level for ‘Rua Tapawhå’  \nactivity by year and gender \n Māori students \n All (%) Boys (%) Girls (%) \nStudent displays all/almost all aspects from high range \nmovement list 26 35 16 \nStudent displays a variety of aspects – mainly mid range with \nsome high range movements 49 47 52 \nStudent displays a few aspects from mid range with some low \nrange movements 15 10 22 \nStudent displays low range movements 9 9 10 \nTable 5.13 Māori Year 4 Movement sequence skills: Percentage of students scoring at each level for  \n‘Movement Sequences’ activity by year and gender \n Māori students \n All (%) Boys (%) Girls (%) \nHigh range: Includes 4 or more elements, 3 aspects of consistency, \nand 3 aspects of cooperative work 40 36 44 \nMid-high range: Includes 2-3 elements, 2 aspects of consistency, and \n2 aspects of cooperative work 48 48 48 \nLow-mid range: Includes at least 3 movements/1 element, 1 aspect \nof consistency, and 1 aspect of cooperative work 12 15 8 \nLow range: No response/don’t know, does not complete 3 \nmovements, no evidence of consistency, and no evidence of \ncooperative work \n1 1 0 \nTable 5.14 Māori Year 8 Movement sequence skills: Percentage of students scoring at each level for  \n‘Movement Sequences’ activity by year and gender \n Māori students \n All (%) Boys (%) Girls (%) \nHigh range: Includes 4 or more elements, 3 aspects of consistency, \nand 3 aspects of cooperative work 47 46 49 \nMid-high range: Includes 2-3 elements, 2 aspects of consistency, and \n2 aspects of cooperative work 45 48 42 \nLow-mid range: Includes at least 3 movements/1 element, 1 aspect \nof consistency, and 1 aspect of cooperative work 7 7 8 \nLow range: No response/don’t know, does not complete 3 \nmovements, no evidence of consistency, and no evidence of \ncooperative work \n1 0 1 \nPhysical activity \nTable 5.15 shows the percentage of Māori students engaging in physical activities outside of school at Year 4 \nand Year 8. Approximately half of students at each year level were involved in physical activities every day. \nGenerally, Year 8 Māori students were engaged in physical activities more frequently than Year 4 students.  \nTable 5.15 Percentage of students reporting different frequency of physical activity  \noutside of school by year level and ethnicity \n \nYear 4 Year 8 \n \nMāori (%) \nN = 159 \nNZE (%) \nN = 479 \nMāori (%) \nN = 189 \nNZE (%) \nN = 453 \nNearly every day 48 50 50 57 \n2-3 times a week 27 35 39 34 \nAbout once a week 18 10 7 5 \nHardly ever 8 4 4 3 \n 82 Chapter 5: NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013 \nWhen asked whether they would like to do more, less or about the same level of physical activity (Table \n5.16) just over half of Year 4 Māori students and a greater percentage (60 percent) of Year 8 Māori \nstudents said they would like to do more. \nTable 5.16 Percentage of students reporting their desired level of physical activity by year level  \nand ethnicity \n \nYear 4 Year 8 \n \nMāori (%) \nN = 161 \nNZE (%) \nN = 480 \nMāori (%) \nN = 189 \nNZE (%) \nN = 456 \nMore 51 55 60 53 \nAbout the same 47 43 38 46 \nLess 2 1 2 1 \nThe number of Māori students who identified different types of barriers to greater physical activity was too \nsmall to accurately report on. However, it should be noted that the small number of Māori students who \nidentified barriers at Year 4 were focused on health, being busy with other things and family circumstances. \nAt Year 8 a greater number of students were able to identify barriers and these were predominantly being \nbusy with other things and health issues, with a minority identifying family circumstances and access barriers. \n5. Benchmarking Māori success \nThis section contrasts the profiles of Year 4 and Year 8 Māori students who scored above the national average \nat their year level. They are compared with the students from the national sample who also scored above the \nnational averages for Year 4 and Year 8 respectively. The 2013 national averages serve as benchmark scores \nwith which to compare health and physical education results for different groups this year. These benchmarks \nmay also be used to compare health and physical education results across future cycles of NMSSA health and \nphysical education. \nTable 5.17 shows the number (and percentage) of Year 4 and Year 8 Māori students who scored above the \nbenchmark for their year level, along with the average level and spread of their scores on the Critical \nThinking in Health and Physical Education achievement measure. The difference between the percentage \nof Māori and All Students reaching the respective benchmarks was similar at Year 4 and Year 8. At Year 4, \n41 percent of Māori students scored above the benchmark compared with 53 percent of All Students and at \nYear 8, the corresponding figures were 39 percent compared with 50 percent. At both year levels the \naverage score for Māori students was three scale units lower than for all students (effect size of \napproximately 0.2).  \nTable 5.17 Year 4 and Year 8: Summary statistics for students scoring above the benchmarks for their year \n Critical Thinking in Health and PE \n  Year 4 students scoring above the national Year 4 average \nYear 8 students scoring above \nthe national Year 8 average \n \nMāori students All students Māori students All students \nNumber above benchmark (of total group) 66 (162) 410 (776) 73 (188) 381 (762) \nPercentage of respective group (%) 41 53 39 50 \nAverage (scale score units) 101 104 124 127 \nSD (scale score units) 8 11 11 12 \n  \n NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013: Chapter 5 83 \nFigures 5.6 and 5.7 contrast the group of Māori students who achieved above the benchmark with the group \nof All Students who scored above the benchmark at Year 4 and Year 8 respectively in relation to gender \nand attitudes to health and physical education. At both year levels, Māori and All Students scoring above \nthe benchmark showed broadly similar patterns with respect to gender and Attitudes to Health and Physical \nEducation. There was no clear pattern relating health and physical education achievement with Attitude to \nHealth or Attitude to Physical Education for students who achieved above the benchmark.  \n \n \nFigure 5.6 Year 4: Percent of Māori students and all students scoring above the benchmark on \nCritical Thinking in Health and PE by gender and Attitude to Health and PE  \n \n  \nFigure 5.7 Year 8: Percent of Māori students and all students scoring above the benchmark on \nCritical Thinking in Health and PE by gender and Attitude to Health and PE  \n  \n  \n 84 Chapter 5: NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013 \nMāori students and opportunities to learn health and physical education \nWhen a particular group is achieving at a high level, it is informative to try to determine factors that are \nassociated with the groups success, which are not present for the less successful group. \nThis section compares Māori students who scored above the benchmark to an equivalent sized group of \nMāori students who gained the lowest scores on the Critical Thinking in Health and Physical Education \nscale with respect to opportunities to learn health and physical education. To make comparisons easily, the \ntwo low frequency categories –‘Not at all’ and ‘A little’ were combined, and compared with the two high \nfrequency categories - ‘Quite a lot’ and ‘Heaps’.  \nTables 5.18 to 5.21 compare statements from the opportunities to learn in health and physical education \nreported by students who achieved above the benchmark and by students who scored below.  \nMāori students in the above benchmark group at Year 4 reported having more frequent opportunities to \ntake action to improve their health after learning something in class, and at Year 8 students reported more \nfrequent opportunities to learn something in health that was important to them. In general there was little \ndifference in the pattern of responses for students above the benchmark compared with those below the \nbenchmark with respect to opportunities to learn physical education.  \nTable 5.18 Year 4 Māori students: Opportunities to learn health by above benchmark and low achievement  \ngroups on Critical Thinking in Health and PE \n Year 4 Māori students scoring above benchmark (N=66) \nComparison group of Year 4 \nMāori students with lowest \nachievement (N=66) \nHow often do you have these opportunities?

Tables 5.24 and 5.25 show the corresponding results for Year 8 students. \nEighty-one percent of Year 4 Māori students and 86 percent of Year 8 Māori students came from low and \nmid decile schools. This contrasts with 49 and 59 percent of Year 4 and Year 8 NZ European students \nattending low and mid decile schools. By number, the group of Māori students from mid decile schools \nwho scored above the benchmark is the largest. However, a greater proportion of Māori students at mid and \nhigh decile schools (about 50 percent) achieved above the benchmark than from low decile schools  \n(29 percent). This was a similar pattern to achievement by decile for the national sample (see Chapter 3). \nFor example, 19 percent of all Year 4 Māori students attended a high decile school and 52 percent of those \nscored above the benchmark. In contrast, 46 percent of Māori students attended a low decile school, but \nonly 29 percent of those achieved above the benchmark.  \n  \n 86 Chapter 5: NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013 \nTable 5.22 Year 4: Number and percentage of Māori students by school decile who participated in \nCritical Thinking in Health and PE and achieved above the benchmark \n  All Māori Students \nMāori students who achieved above the national \naverage as a percentage of all Māori in that decile \ngroup \nSchool Decile N % N % \nLow 75 46 22 29 \nMid 56 35 28 50 \nHigh 31 19 16 52 \nTotal 162 100 66 - \nTable 5.23 Year 4: Number and percentage of NZ European students by school decile who participated in  \nCritical Thinking in Health and PE and achieved above the benchmark \n  NZ European \nNZ European students who achieved \nabove the national average as a \npercentage of all NZ European in that \ndecile group \nSchool Decile N % N % \nLow 48 10 22 46 \nMid 186 39 118 63 \nHigh 249 52 164 66 \nTotal 483 100 304 - \nTable 5.24 Year 8: Number and percentage of Māori students by school decile who participated in  \nCritical Thinking in Health and PE and achieved above the benchmark \n  All Māori Students \nMāori students who achieved above \nthe national average as a percentage \nof all Māori in that decile group \nSchool Decile N % N % \nLow 66 35 20 30 \nMid 95 51 38 40 \nHigh 27 14 15 56 \nTotal 188 100 73 - \nTable 5.25 Year 8: Number and percentage of NZ European students by school decile who participated in  \nCritical Thinking in Health and PE and achieved above the benchmark \n  NZ European \nNZ European students who achieved \nabove the national average as a \npercentage of all NZ European in that \ndecile group \nSchool Decile N % N % \nLow 32 7 19 59 \nMid 236 52 126 53 \nHigh 187 41 125 67 \nTotal 455 100 270 - \n \n  \n NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013: Chapter 5 87 \nThe interaction between decile and ethnicity \nReporting on differences between groups of students in New Zealand by ethnicity is a complex matter. \nAnalysis is complicated on two counts. First, as already reported, ethnic groups (Māori and NZ European) \nare disproportionately represented across deciles, with a high proportion of Māori students and a small \nproportion of NZ European students attending lower decile schools. Secondly, students may identify with \nmore than one ethnic group. It is difficult to make robust statistical statements about these two groups when \nthere is substantial ‘blurring’ with regard to group membership.  \nTo attempt to extrapolate an accurate picture, the health and physical education dataset for this analysis has \nbeen reduced to those who identify with Māori, NZ European, or both ethnic groups, and decile has been \ngrouped by quintile21. \nFor each year level separately, models were run to examine effects on performance on the Critical Thinking \nin Health and Physical Education scale due to quintile and ethnicity. The models showed that there was an \neffect due to ethnicity which remained after accounting for the quintile effect at both year levels. That is, \nthere is a difference in average critical thinking scores between Māori and NZ European students over and \nabove the difference accounted for by quintile. This difference is constant (as far as the model can \ndetermine) across all quintiles.  \nAt Year 4 there is a difference of 9 scale score units on average between Māori and NZ European \nperformance on the Critical Thinking in Health and Physical Education scale after quintile has been taken \ninto account. This equates to an effect size of about 0.4. At Year 8, the equivalent difference is slightly \nsmaller - about 7 scale score units, with Māori students scoring lower than NZ European on average - an \neffect size of about 0.3.  \nThese results should be interpreted with caution. The model's ability to precisely assess how Māori students \nare performing in higher decile schools (and how NZ European students are performing in lower decile \nschools) is compromised by the disproportionate numbers of students in those deciles with respect to their \nethnicity. Details of this analysis can be found in Appendix 5 along with graphics giving an overall \nrepresentation of the results. The graphics display important information about the distribution of ethnic \ngroups across quintiles, and the variability of scores within quintile.  \n \n                                                        \n21  Decile 1-2  Quintile 1, Decile 3-4  Quintile 2, … , Decile 9-10  Quintile 5 \n 88 Chapter 6: NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013 \n6 Pasifika Student Achievement in Health and Physical Education \nThis chapter presents the findings for Pasifika22 student achievement in health and physical education (PE) \nat Year 4 and Year 8. It looks at achievement within year levels and presents it against the levels of the \nNZC health and physical education. It examines the difference in achievement between Year 4 and Year 8, \nand differences among sub-groups of gender, school decile, and type of school.  The chapter presents a \nprofile of Pasifika students who scored above the national average at Year 4 and Year 8 with respect to \ngender, school decile, attitudes and opportunities to learn health and physical education. It also provides \ninformation on Pasifika students’ understanding of well-being, movement skills, and frequency of physical \nactivity outside of school. \nIn this chapter, we compare the Pasifika student sub-group to all students in the national sample. When \nmaking these comparisons the national sample will be referred to as ‘All Students’. \nFor some of the tables used in this chapter, particularly those associated with population sub-groups, fuller \ntables of averages, standard deviations, sample sizes, effect sizes, and 95 percent confidence intervals can \nbe found in Appendix 4.  \n  \n                                                        \n22  Students could identify with up to three ethnic groups. All students who identified as Pasifika were included in these analyses \n NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013: Chapter 6 89 \nSuccess and achievement of Pasifika students in health and physical \neducation  – An overview \nAchievement in health and physical education \nWhile Year 4 and Year 8 Pasifika students tended to achieve at a lower level than NZ European students, \nmany features of Pasifika student achievement followed similar patterns to the national samples with a \nwide distribution of scores at both year levels and some overlap in the achievement of Year 4 students and \nYear 8 students (Chapter 3). \nPasifika students from low decile schools scored lower on average than those at high decile schools at Year \n4 but there were no significant differences at Year 8. Achievement in critical thinking in health and \nphysical education was similar at both year levels for boys and girls, and for students at different types of \nschools. However, the numbers for some of the comparisons were small. \nPasifika students made similar progress between Year 4 and Year 8 as All Students.  \nThe majority of Pasifika and NZ European students’ description of well-being was categorised as \nmental/emotional (taha hinengaro), social (taha whānau) and physical (taha tinana) dimensions of well-\nbeing. Understanding of well-being increased from Year 4 to Year 8 with the greatest differences being for \nthe physical and spiritual dimensions of well-being. At both year levels very few students mentioned the \nspiritual spiritual (taha wairua) dimension of well-being.  \nPasifika students’ movement skills, strategic action skills, and movement sequences skills developed \nconsiderably from Year 4 to Year 8 showing a similar increase for All Students. At each year level, slightly \nmore boys performed higher than girls on the first two of these skills, while more Year 4 Pasifika girls than \nboys demonstrated high level skills in movement sequences.  \nAchievement against curriculum levels \nStudents’ peformance on the Critical Thinking for Health and Physical Education measure was aligned to \nthe NZC levels in health and physical education. Ninety-two percent of Year 4 Pasifika students were \nachieving at Level 2 or above. This was similar to All Students and exceeds the expectations expressed in \nthe NZC for health and physical education for Year 4 students. Twenty-seven percent of Year 8 Pasifika \nstudents were achieving at Level 4 or above. This was fewer than All Students (57 percent) and below the \nNZC expectations Year 8 students. \nPhysical activities outside of school \nThe majority of Pasifika students at both year levels were involved frequently each week (more than 2-3 \ntimes a week) in physical activities outside of school with Year 8 students being more active than Year 4 \nstudents. \nBenchmarking Pasifika success \nThe national average on the Critical Thinking in Health and Physical Education scale at Year 4 and Year 8 \nis the benchmark for each respective year level. Just over one quarter of Pasifika students scored above the \nbenchmark at Year 4 and Year 8. This was lower than for All Students. Pasifika students who scored above \nthe benchmark reported similar attitudes to health and physical education compared with a group of \nPasifika students who scored below the benchmark. In physical education, at both year levels Pasifika \nstudents above the benchmark reported having more frequent opportunities to use equipment to play and \nmove around, and to learn new skills and different ways of moving. They also reported more frequent \nopportunities to learn about playing fair at Year 4, and to learn how to be safe when moving in different \nways at Year 8. \nThe interaction between decile and ethnicity \nAt each year level, a greater proportion of Pasifika students at high decile schools achieved above the \nbenchmark than Pasifika students from mid and low decile schools. A study of how decile and ethnicity \nrelate to achievement on the Critical Thinking in Health and Physical Education scale indicated that decile \nis strongly associated with achievement on this scale. Average Critical Thinking in Health and Physical \nEducation scale scores increased with decile. In addition, there was an effect due to ethnicity which \nremained after accounting for the decile effect. \n 90 Chapter 6: NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013 \n1. Year 4 Pasifika student achievement in health and physical education  \nTable 6.1 shows how Year 4 Pasifika students performed on the health and physical education assessment. \nIt provides the average score on the Critical Thinking in Health and Physical Education scale, standard \ndeviation and sample size. \nTable 6.1 Year 4 Pasifika student overall achievement in Critical Thinking in Health and PE \n \nCritical Thinking in Health and PE \nAverage (scale score units) 75 \nSD (scale score units) 19 \nN 98 \nAt Year 4 the average score for Pasifika students was 75 scale score units in Critical Thinking in Health and \nPhysical Education. This was lower than the average of 89 scale score units for All Students but in the same \nband of achievement23. The 50 percent of Year 4 Pasifika students who clustered around the average would \ntypically be able to demonstrate the same competencies described in Chapter 3 for All Students at Year 4.  \nA curriculum alignment exercise was undertaken to link performance ranges on the Critical Thinking in Health \nand Physical Education scale to the NZC (Appendix 3).  Creating this link allowed scale scores for the health and \nphysical education measure to be reported in terms of curriculum expectations. However, it should be noted that \nthe scale does not assess the full range of the health and physical education learning area. Several aspects, e.g. \nunderstanding of well-being and movement skills were assessed and reported on separately. \nTable 6.2 shows Year 4 Pasifika student performance on the Critical Thinking in Health and Physical \nEducation measure at Level 2 of the NZC. It compares these results to those for All Students. Ninety-two \npercent of Pasifika students achieved at Level 2 or above, compared to 97 percent of All Students. This \nlevel represents the expected level of performance for Year 4 students at the end of the year and indicates \nthat almost all students were achieving above the expected level in the domains assessed.  \nTable 6.2 Percentage of Year 4 Pasifika and All Students achieving at the NZC level 2 on the  \nCritical Thinking in Health and PE measure \n Critical Thinking in Health and PE \n Pasifika students (%) All Students (%) \nLevel 2 and above 92 97 \nNot yet Level 2 8 3 \n \n  \n                                                        \n23  Performance bands for the health and physical education are described in Chapter 2. \n NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013: Chapter 6 91 \n2. Year 8 Pasifika student achievement in health and physical education  \nTable 6.3 provides the average scale score, standard deviation and sample size for Year 8 Pasifika students \non the Critical Thinking in Health and Physical Education scale.  \nTable 6.3 - Year 8 Pasifika student overall achievement in Critical Thinking in Health and PE \n  Critical Thinking in Health and PE \nAverage (scale score units) 97 \nSD (scale score units) 21 \nN 101 \nAt Year 8, the average score for Pasifika students in Critical Thinking in Health and Physical Education was \n97 scale score units, compared to 111 for All Students. Some of the middle 50 percent of Year 8 Pasifika \nstudents were beginning to demonstrate the same competencies described for All Students at Year 8 with \nothers performing at the top of the previous performance band described for Year 4 students (Chapter 3).  \nTable 6.4 shows how Year 8 Pasifika students performed on the Critical Thinking in Health and Physical \nEducation scale in terms of the NZC levels. Just over quarter of Pasifika students were achieving at Level 4 \nand above compared to just over half of All Students. Overall, Year 8 students were achieving below the \nNZC expectations for health and physical education. \nTable 6.4 Percentage of Year 8 Pasifika and All Students achieving at the NZC level 4 on the  \nCritical Thinking in Health and PE measure \n Critical Thinking in Health and PE \n Pasifika students (%) All Students (%) \nLevel 4 and above 27 51 \nNot yet Level 4 73 49 \n3. Comparison of Year 4 and Year 8 Pasifika student achievement  \nFigure 6.1 shows the distribution of \nYear 4 and Year 8 Pasifika students on \nthe Critical Thinking in Health and \nPhysical Education scale. As expected, \non average Year 8 Pasifika students had \nhigher achievement scores than Year 4 \nPasifika students. Similar to the full \nnational student group, there was a wide \ndistribution of scores at both year \nlevels. \nFigures 6.2 and 6.3 illustrate the spread \nof achievement across the NZC levels \nfor Year 4 and Year 8 Pasifika students \non the Critical Thinking in Health and \nPhysical Education measure. The \nblurred lines dividing the levels reflect \nthe fact that these boundaries are not \nprecisely defined and it is therefore not \npossible to be exact about the \nproportions of students within each \nlevel.   \n \nFigure 6.1  Pasifika student achievement for Critical Thinking in \nHealth and PE \n 92 Chapter 6: NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013 \nThe figures show that almost all Year 4 Pasifika students were achieving at Level 2 and above, similar to \nAll Students. Twenty-seven percent of Year 8 Pasifika students were achieving at Level 4 and above. This \nis less than the proportion of All Students at Year 8 achieving at that level. \n    \n \nFigure 6.2  Distribution of Year 4 Pasifika and All \nStudents achievement in Critical Thinking  \nin Health and PE against levels of the NZC \nhealth and PE  \nFigure 6.3 Distribution of Year 8 Pasifika and All \nStudents achievement in Critical Thinking  \nin Health and PE against levels of the NZC \nhealth and PE  \n \nTable 6.5 shows for the Critical Thinking in Health and Physical Education scale, the differences in \naverage scores between Year 4 and Year 8 Pasifika students expressed in scale score units and effect size, \nand the averages and standard deviations.  \nThe Pasifika student average score was lower than those of All Students at both year levels (See Chapter 3). \nHowever, the difference between the average scale score for Year 4 and Year 8 Pasifika students was the \nsame as that for All Students - 22 scale score units. This corresponded to an average annual effect size of \n0.28 for All Students and 0.27 for Pasifika students. Pasifika students made similar progress to All Students \nbetween Year 4 and Year 8. \nTable 6.5 - Pasifika student achievement in Critical Thinking in Health and PE and  \ndifference of achievement by year level \n  Critical Thinking in Health and PE  \n  Year 4 Year 8 \nAverage (scale score units) 75 97 \nSD (scale score units) 19 21 \nN 98 101 \nYear 4/Year 8 difference* 22 \nEffect size 1.08 \nAnnual average effect size 0.27 \n* Difference = Year 8-Year 4 \n NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013: Chapter 6 93 \nSub-group comparisons \nFigures 6.4 and 6.5 display the level and spread of scores for Critical Thinking in Health and Physical Education \nfor Year 4 and Year 8 Pasifika students respectively, for gender, school decile24 and type of school25.  \n \n \nFigure 6.4 Year 4 Pasifika student scores for Critical Thinking in Health and PE by gender, school \ndecile and type (F.P.=Full Primary, Cont.=Contributing) \n \n \nFigure 6.5 Year 8 Pasifika student scores for Critical Thinking in Health and PE by gender, school \ndecile and type  \nF.P.=Full Primary, Int.=Intermediate) \n \n  \n                                                        \n24  Low decile schools (1-3); Mid decile schools (4-7); High decile schools (8-10) \n(http://www.minedu.govt.nz/NZEducation/EducationPolicies/Schools/SchoolOperations/Resourcing/OperationalFunding/Deciles.aspx)  \n25  Full Primary (Year 1 – 8); Contributing (Year 1 – 6); Intermediate (Year 7 – 8); Composite (Year 1- 13); Secondary (Year 7-13) \n 94 Chapter 6: NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013 \nTable 6.6 summarises average scale score differences and effect sizes between sub-groups at Year 4 and Year 8. \nThere is a pattern of increasing average scale scores for Pasifika students at both year levels attending low, \nmid and high decile schools. Year 4 Pasifika students from low decile schools scored significantly lower \nthan those from high decile schools. No differences by decile were found at Year 8. Results did not differ \nby gender, or school type at either year level. For some of the comparisons the number of students is \nrelatively small.

Pasifika students’ understanding of well-being, movement skills and \nreported physical activity \nAs explained in Chapter 3 the NZC identifies the concept of Hauora as being at the heart of learning in Health \nand PE. Hauora is defined as a Māori philosophy of well-being that includes four dimensions: spiritual  \n(taha wairua), mental/emotional (taha hinengaro), social (taha whānau) and physical (taha tinana). Students \nwere told there are lots of different kinds of things that people do or have in their life to helps them feel well \nor happy. They were asked to draw pictures or write words to show the things that people do or have to help \nkeep them well or happy.  They discussed the pictures with an interviewer. Interviews were analysed and \nelements of well-being identified were categorised into the different dimensions of well-being. Percentage \nfrequencies reported in tables in this section may not always sum to 100 percent due to rounding. \nTable 6.8 displays the percentage of Pasifika students at Year 4 and Year 8 whose responses were \ncategorised into each of the four dimensions of well-being, alongside those for NZ European students. See \nTable 3.20, Chapter 3 for the examples of how student responses were categorised. \nTable 6.8 Percentage of students identifying dimensions of well-being by year level and ethnicity \n \nYear 4 Year 8 \n \nPasifika (%) \nN = 98 \nNZE (%) \nN = 481 \nPasifika (%) \nN = 102 \nNZE (%) \nN = 457 \nPhysical 45 63 59 72 \nMental/Emotional 86 85 92 93 \nSocial 78 71 83 86 \nSpiritual 9 4 23 13 \nSimilar high proportions of Pasifika and NZ European students described the mental/emotional and social \ndimensions of well-being. At each year level, fewer Pasifika students than NZ Europeans described the \nphysical dimension, and more Pasifika than NZ European students mentioned the spiritual dimension \nalthough both were low. \nOverall these results show that the percentage of each dimension of well-being described increased from Year \n4 to Year 8 with the greatest differences being for the physical and spiritual dimensions for Pasifika students.  \nMovement skills \nThe following tables display the percentage of Pasifika students by gender for movement skills on three \ntasks: Rippa Tag (Table 6.9 and 6.10), Rua Tapawhā (Table 6.11 and 6.12), and Movement Sequences \n(Table 6.13 and 6.14). Refer to Chapter 3 for the description of the tasks and skills assessed, the scoring \nguide for each task and the findings for All Students. \nYear 4 Pasifika students on average demonstrated low to mid range skills in movement skills and strategic \naction skills, similar to All Students. Boys scored slightly higher than girls in strategic action skills but \nunlike All Students, not in movement skills. Year 8 students performed on average in the mid to high range \nof skills for these movement skills, similar to All Students. There was still a gender difference with more \nboys than girls at the high skill level. However, a greater percentage of Pasifika girls scored in the high \nrange at Year 8 for strategic action skills than for girls in All Students. \nSimilar to All Students, Pasifika students at both year levels showed stronger skills (mid-high to high \nrange) in movement sequences than the other categories of movement skills, with smaller difference \nbetween boys and girls. Although more girls than boys performed at the mid and high skill levels at Year 4, \nat Year 8 performances were similar.  \n  \n 96 Chapter 6: NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013 \nTable 6.9 Pasifika Year 4 Movement skills: Percentage of students scoring at each level for  \n‘Rippa Tag’ activity by year and gender \n Pasifika students \n All (%) Boys (%) Girls (%) \nStudent displays all/almost all aspects from high range \nmovement list 7 7 7 \nStudent displays a variety of aspects – mainly mid range \nwith some high range movements 24 30 16 \nStudent displays a few aspects from mid range with some \nlow range movements 51 47 56 \nStudent displays low range movements 18 16 21 \nTable 6.10 Pasifika Year 8 Movement skills: Percentage of students scoring at each level for  \n‘Rippa Tag’ activity by year and gender \n Pasifika students \n All (%) Boys (%) Girls (%) \nStudent displays all/almost all aspects from high range \nmovement list 19 28 13 \nStudent displays a variety of aspects – mainly mid range \nwith some high range movements 36 38 34 \nStudent displays a few aspects from mid range with some \nlow range movements 29 21 36 \nStudent displays low range movements 16 13 18 \nTable 6.11 Pasifika Year 4 Strategic action skills: Percentage of students scoring at each level for  \n‘Rua Tapawhå’ activity by year and gender \n Pasifika students \n All (%) Boys (%) Girls (%) \nStudent displays all/almost all aspects from high range \nmovement list 5 7 2 \nStudent displays a variety of aspects – mainly mid range with \nsome high range movements 39 39 40 \nStudent displays a few aspects from mid range with some low \nrange movements 47 44 51 \nStudent displays low range movements 9 11 7 \nTable 6.12 Pasifika Year 8 Strategic action skills: Percentage of students scoring at each level for  \n‘Rua Tapawhå’ activity by year and gender \n Pasifika students \n All (%) Boys (%) Girls (%) \nStudent displays all/almost all aspects from high range \nmovement list 28 32 25 \nStudent displays a variety of aspects – mainly mid range with \nsome high range movements 50 51 48 \nStudent displays a few aspects from mid range with some \nlow range movements 17 15 18 \nStudent displays low range movements 6 2 9 \n \n  \n NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013: Chapter 6 97 \nTable 6.13 Pasifika Year 4 Movement sequences skills: Percentage of students scoring at each level for  \n‘Movement Sequences’ activity by year and gender \n Pasifika students \n All (%) Boys (%) Girls (%) \nHigh range: Includes 4 or more elements, 3 aspects of \nconsistency, and 3 aspects of co-operative work 25 21 30 \nMid-high range: Includes 2-3 elements, 2 aspects of \nconsistency, and 2 aspects of co-operative work 58 56 60 \nLow-mid range: Includes at least 3 movements/one element, \n1 aspect of consistency, and 1 aspect of co-operative work 16 21 9 \nLow range: No response/don’t know, does not complete 3 \nmovements, no evidence of consistency, and no evidence of \nco-operative work \n1 2 0 \nTable 6.14 Pasifika Year 8 Movement sequences skills: Percentage of students scoring at each level for  \n‘Movement Sequences’ activity by year and gender \n Pasifika students \n All (%) Boys (%) Girls (%) \nHigh range: Includes 4 or more elements, 3 aspects of \nconsistency, and 3 aspects of co-operative work 34 38 30 \nMid-high range: Includes 2-3 elements, 2 aspects of \nconsistency, and 2 aspects of co-operative work 55 51 59 \nLow-mid range: Includes at least 3 movements/one element, \n1 aspect of consistency, and 1 aspect of co-operative work 10 11 9 \nLow range: No response/don’t know, does not complete 3 \nmovements, no evidence of consistency, and no evidence of \nco-operative work \n1 0 2 \nPhysical activity \nTable 6.15 shows the percentage of Pasifika students engaging in physical activities out of school at Year 4 \nand Year 8. Sixty-three percent of Pasifika students at Year 4 and 86 percent at Year 8 were frequently \ninvolved in physical activities (2-3 times a week or more).  \nNotably fewer Pasifika than NZ European students were involved in physical activities frequently at Year 4 \n(63 percent compared with 85 percent). The difference at Year 8 was much smaller (86 percent compared \nwith 91 percent).  \nTable 6.15 Percentage of students reporting different frequency of physical activity  \noutside of school by year level and ethnicity \n \nYear 4 Year 8 \n \nPasifika (%) \nN = 97 \nNZE (%) \nN = 479 \nPasifika (%) \nN = 102 \nNZE (%) \nN = 453 \nNearly every day 36 50 41 57 \n2-3 times a week 27 35 45 34 \nAbout once a week 23 10 9 5 \nHardly ever 14 4 5 3 \n \n  \n 98 Chapter 6: NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013 \nWhen asked whether they would like to do more, less or about the same level of physical activity  \n(Table 6.16) just over half of Year 4 Pasifika students and a greater percentage (64 percent) of Year 8 \nPasifika students said they would like to do more. \nTable 6.16 Percentage of students reporting theis desired level of physical activity by year level  \nand ethnicity \n Year 4 Year 8 \n \nPasifika (%) \nN = 98 \nNZE (%) \nN = 480 \nPasifika (%) \nN = 102 \nNZE (%) \nN = 456 \nMore 56 55 64 53 \nLess 10 1 4 1 \nAbout the same 34 43 32 46 \nThe number of Pasifika students who identified different types of barriers to greater physical activity was \ntoo small to accurately report on.  However, it should be noted that only three Pasifika students at Year 4 \nidentified barriers to participating in more physical activity outside of school (all health related). At Year 8 \nthe corresponding number was 16, and almost half of those reported being busy with other things as the \nprimary barrier to being more physically active. \n5. Benchmarking Pasifika Success \nThis section contrasts the profiles of Year 4 and Year 8 Pasifika students who scored above the national \naverage at their year level. They are compared with students from the All Students group who also scored \nabove the national averages for Year 4 and Year 8 respectively, on the Critical Thinking in Health and \nPhysical Education scale. The 2013 national averages serve as benchmark scores with which to compare \nhealth and physical education results for different groups this year. These benchmarks may also be used to \ncompare health and physical education results across future cycles of NMSSA health and physical education.  \nTable 6.17 shows the number (and percentage) of Year 4 and Year 8 Pasifika and All Students who scored \nabove the benchmarks for their year level, along with the level and spread of their scores on the Critical \nThinking in Health and Physical Education measure. At Year 4, 27 percent of Pasifika students scored \nabove the benchmark compared with 53 percent of All Students at Year 4. At Year 8, a similar percentage \nof Pasifika students scored above the benchmark. The difference between Pasifika and All Students scoring \nabove the benchmark was similar at Year 8 (26 percent compared with 50 percent). Of the students scoring \nabove the benchmarks, Pasifika students scored 6 scale score units lower than All Students at Year 4, and 8 \nscale units lower at Year 8. \nTable 6.17 Summary statistics for Year 4 and Year 8 Pasifika and All Students scoring above their respective benchmarks  \n Critical Thinking in Health and PE \n  Year 4 students scoring above  the national Year 4 average \nYear 8 students scoring above  \nthe national Year 8 average \n \nPasifika students All students Pasifika students All students \nNumber above benchmark (of total group) 26 (98) 410 (776) 26 (101) 381 (762) \nPercentage of respective group (%) 27 53 26 50 \nAverage (scale score units) 98 104 119 127 \nSD (scale score units) 6 11 6 12 \nFigures 6.6 and 6.7 contrast the group of Pasifika students scoring above the benchmark with the group of \nAll Students who scored above the benchmark at Year 4 and Year 8 respectively in relation to gender, and \nattitudes to health and physical education. At both year levels the above benchmark groups of Pasifika and \nAll Students showed broadly similar patterns with respect to gender and Attitude to Health and Attitude to \nPhysical Education. There was no clear pattern relating health and physical education achievement with \nAttitude to Health or Attitude to Physical Education for students who achieved above the benchmark.   \n NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013: Chapter 6 99 \n   \nFigure 6.6 Year 4: Percent of Pasifika students and all students scoring above the benchmark \non Critical Thinking in Health and PE by gender and Attitude to Health and PE \n \n \nFigure 6.7 Year 8: Percent of Pasifika students and all students scoring above the benchmark in \nCritical Thinking in Health and PE by gender and Attitude to Health and PE  \n \n  \n 100 Chapter 6: NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013 \nPasifika students and opportunities to learn health and physical education  \nWhen a particular group is achieving at a high level, it is informative to try and determine factors that are \nassociated with their success, which are not present for the less successful group. \nThis section compares Pasifika students who scored above the benchmark to a similar sized group of \nPasifika students who gained the lowest scores on the Critical Thinking in Health and Physical Education \nscale with respect to opportunities to learn health and physical education. To make comparisons easily the \ntwo low frequency categories – ‘Not at all’ and ‘A little’ are combined, and compared with the two high \nfrequency categories - ‘Quite a lot’ and ‘Heaps’.  \nTables 6.18 to 6.21 compare statements about the opportunities to learn in health and in physical education \nreported by students who achieved above the benchmark and by students who scored below. It should be noted \nthat the numbers in these groups are small, and differences cannot be considered as nationally representative. \nOverall, the pattern of responses of Pasifika students above the benchmark and those below the benchmark \nat both year levels were very similar with respect to opportunities to learn health. In physical education \nsome differences were observed. At both year levels Pasifika students in the above benchmark group \nreported having more frequent opportunities to use equipment to play and move around, and to learn new \nskills and different ways of moving. At Year 4, more students in the below benchmark group reported \nhaving no or very little opportunity to learn about playing fair, and at Year 8, having no or very little \nopportunity to learn how to be safe when moving in different ways.  \nTable 6.18 Year 4 Pasifika students: Opportunities to learn health by above benchmark and low achievement  \ngroups on Critical Thinking in Health and PE \n \nYear 4 Pasifika students scoring \nabove benchmark  \n(N=26) \nComparison group of Year 4 Pasifika \nstudents with lowest achievement \n(N=26) \n Not at all/ A little (%) \nQuite a lot/ \nHeaps (%) \nNot at all/ \nA little (%) \nQuite a lot/ \nHeaps (%) \nWork in groups to think about and \ndiscuss things in health 44 56 50 50 \nLearn something in health that is \nimportant to me 32 68 21 79 \nTake action to improve my health after \nlearning something in class 17 83 28 72 \nShare things I've learned about health \nwith others 44 56 40 60 \nMy whole class does things that help me \nlearn about health 40 60 40 60 \nTable 6.19 Year 8 Pasifika students: Opportunities to learn health by above benchmark and low  \nachievement groups on Critical Thinking in Health and PE \n \nYear 8 Pasifika students scoring \nabove benchmark  \n(N=26) \nComparison group of Year 8 Pasifika \nstudents with lowest achievement \n(N=26) \n Not at all/ A little (%) \nQuite a lot/ \nHeaps (%) \nNot at all/ \nA little (%) \nQuite a lot/ \nHeaps (%) \nWork in groups to think about and \ndiscuss things in health 44 56 46 54 \nLearn something in health that is \nimportant to me 24 76 31 69 \nTake action to improve my health after \nlearning something in class 40 60 48 52 \nShare things I've learned about health \nwith others 62 38 54 46 \nMy whole class does things that help me \nlearn about health 36 64 38 62 \n  \n NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013: Chapter 6 101 \nTable 6.20 Year 4 Pasifika students: Opportunities to learn PE by above benchmark and low achievement  \ngroups on Critical Thinking in Health and PE \n \nYear 4 Pasifika students scoring \nabove benchmark  \n(N=26) \nComparison group of Year 4 Pasifika \nstudents with lowest achievement \n(N=26) \n Not at all/ A little (%) \nQuite a lot/ \nHeaps (%) \nNot at all/ \nA little (%) \nQuite a lot/ \nHeaps (%) \nUse equipment to play and move around 16 84 40 60 \nHave challenges like making up \nmovement patterns or solving problems 28 72 28 72 \nWork in teams or groups 12 88 20 80 \nLearn about playing fair 8 92 20 80 \nLearn how to be safe when I am moving \nin different ways 16 84 17 83 \nLearn new skills and different ways of \nmoving 8 92 24 76 \nTable 6.21 Year 8 Pasifika students: Opportunities to learn PE by above benchmark and low achievement  \ngroups on Critical Thinking in Health and PE \n \nYear 8 Pasifika students scoring \nabove benchmark  \n(N=26) \nComparison group of Year 8 Pasifika \nstudents with lowest achievement \n(N=26) \n Not at all/ A little (%) \nQuite a lot/ \nHeaps (%) \nNot at all/ \nA little (%) \nQuite a lot/ \nHeaps (%) \nUse equipment to play and move around 4 96 20 80 \nHave challenges like making up \nmovement patterns or solving problems 28 72 27 73 \nWork in teams or groups 4 96 15 85 \nLearn about playing fair 8 92 12 88 \nLearn how to be safe when I am moving \nin different ways 0 100 24 76 \nLearn new skills and different ways of \nmoving 4 96 15 85 \nPasifika student achievement by decile \nTables 6.22 and 6.23 show the total number of Year 4 Pasifika and NZ European students respectively, \nassessed in health and physical education and the number of each group who achieved above the \nbenchmark for their year, broken down by school decile. Tables 6.24 and 6.25 show the corresponding \nresults for Year 8 students. It should be noted that the numbers of Pasifika is very low in some sub-groups \nand the findings should be interpreted with caution. \nAt Year 4, about 90 percent of Pasifika students came from low and mid decile schools, with two thirds \nfrom low decile schools. This contrasts with just under 50 percent of NZ European students attending low \nand mid decile schools. At Year 8, 95 percent of Pasifika students came from low and mid decile schools \ncompared to 59 percent of NZ European students.  \nBy number, the majority of Pasifika students who scored above the benchmark came from low and mid \ndecile schools. However when one considers the total number of Pasifika students attending each decile \ngroup, the picture changes. A greater proportion of the Pasifika students from high decile schools scored \nabove the benchmark than those who attended mid and low decile schools. This was similar to the national \nsample and the Māori sample (Chapters 3 and 5). For example, at Year 4, 9 percent of all Pasifika students   \n 102 Chapter 6: NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013 \nattended high decile schools. Seventy-eight percent of those students scored above the benchmark.  \nIn contrast 65 percent of all Pasifika students attended low decile schools and only 19 percent of those \nscored above the benchmark. This pattern is very similar to that observed in the NMSSA assessment of \nachievement in Science (2012). \nTable 6.22  Year 4: Number and percentage of Pasifika students by school decile who participated in Critical Thinking  \nin the Health and PE and achieved above the benchmark \n  Pasifika Students \nPasifika students who achieved above the \nnational average as a percentage of all \nPasifika in that decile group \nSchool Decile N % N % \nLow 64 65 12 19 \nMid 25 26 7 28 \nHigh 9 9 7 78 \nTotal 98 100 26 - \nTable 6.23 Year 4: Number and percentage of NZ European students by school decile who participated in Critical  \nThinking in the Health and PE and achieved above the benchmark \n NZ European \nNZ European students who achieved above \nthe national average as a percentage of all NZ \nEuropean in that decile group \nSchool Decile N % N % \nLow 48 10 22 46 \nMid 186 39 118 63 \nHigh 249 52 164 66 \nTotal 483 100 304 - \nTable 6.24 Year 8: Number and percentage of Pasifika students by school decile who participated in Critical Thinking  \nin the Health and PE and achieved above the benchmark \n  Pasifika Students \nPasifika students who achieved above the \nnational average as a percentage of all \nPasifika in that decile group \nSchool Decile N % N % \nLow 66 65 15 23 \nMid 30 30 9 30 \nHigh 5 5 2 40 \nTotal 101 100 26 - \nTable 6.25 Year 8: Number and percentage of NZ European students by school decile who participated in Critical  \nThinking in the Health and PE and achieved above the benchmark \n  NZ European \nNZ European students who achieved above \nthe national average as a percentage of all NZ \nEuropean in that decile group \nSchool Decile N % N % \nLow 32 7 19 59 \nMid 236 52 126 53 \nHigh 187 41 125 67 \nTotal 455 100 270 - \n \n  \n NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013: Chapter 6 103 \nThe interaction between decile and ethnicity \nReporting on differences between groups of students in New Zealand by ethnicity is a complex matter. \nAnalysis is complicated on two counts. First, as already reported, ethnic groups (Pasifika and NZ \nEuropean) are disproportionately represented across deciles, with a high proportion of Pasifika students and \nsmall proportion of NZ European students attending lower decile schools. Secondly, students may identify \nwith more than one ethnic group. It is difficult to make robust statistical statements about these two groups \nwhen there is substantial \"blurring\" with regard to group membership.  \nTo attempt to extrapolate an accurate picture, the health and physical education dataset for this analysis has been \nreduced to those who identify with Pasifika, NZ European, or both ethnic groups, and decile has been grouped \nby quintile26. \nFor each year level separately, models were run to examine effects on performance on the Critical Thinking \nin Health and Physical Education scale due to quintile and ethnicity. The models showed that there was an \neffect due to ethnicity which remained after accounting for the quintile effect at both year levels. That is, \nthere was a difference in average critical thinking scores between Pasifika and NZ European students over \nand above the difference accounted for by quintile. This difference was constant (as far as the model can \ndetermine) across all quintiles.  \nAt Year 4 there was a difference of 15 scale score units on average between Pasifika and NZ European \nperformance on the Critical Thinking in Health and Physical Education scale after quintile has been taken \ninto account. This equates to an effect size of about 0.7. At Year 8, Pasifika students scored lower than NZ \nEuropean on average, by about the same amount - 14 scale score units. \nThese results should be interpreted with caution. The model's ability to precisely assess how Pasifika \nstudents are performing in higher decile schools (and how NZ European students are performing in lower \ndecile schools) is compromised by the disproportionate numbers of students in those deciles with respect to \ntheir ethnicity. Details of this analysis can be found in Appendix 5 along with graphics giving an overall \nrepresentation of the results. The graphics display important information about the distribution of ethnic \ngroups across quintiles, and the variability of scores within quintile.  \n \n                                                        \n26  Decile 1-2  Quintile 1, Decile 3-4  Quintile 2, … , Decile 9-10  Quintile 5 \n 104 Chapter 7: NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013 \n7 Achievement of Students with  Special Education Needs in Health  \nand Physical Education \nThis chapter presents the findings for achievement in health and physical education (PE) of students with \nspecial education needs at Year 4 and Year 8. It also reports on differences in achievement between students \nwith special education needs and between year levels.  The chapter presents achievement of students with \nspecial education needs against the levels of the NZC health and physical education and provides details about \nthe decile, gender and attitudes to health and physical education of students with special education needs who \nachieved above the national average on the Critical Thinking in Health and Physical Education measure at \nYear 4 and Year 8.  \nIn this chapter, we compare students with special education needs to all students in the national sample. As \nin chapters 5 and 6, when making these comparisons the national sample will be referred to as ‘All \nStudents’. We also make comparisons to a complementary group of students who do not fall into any of the \nspecial education needs categories. This group is referred to as the ‘no special education needs’ group. \nThe number of special education needs students in the 2013 was relatively small. This means findings \nshould be interpreted with caution.  \nSome tables in this chapter contain asterisks. Asterisks are used to indicate where there are very small \nsample numbers and it is impossible to report percentages or other statistics meaningfully. All statistical \ndetails about sample sizes, sub-group average scale scores, standard deviations, effect sizes and confidence \nintervals are contained in Appendix 4. \n  \n NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013: Chapter 7 105 \nSuccess and achievement of students with special education needs in health \nand physical education – An overview \nParticipation of students with special education needs \nStudents with high and moderate special education needs were included in NMSSA. Although the number \nof students with high special education needs was small, students with moderate special education needs \nmade up seven percent of All Students at Year 4, and five percent at Year 8. Students on referral were not \nincluded in the analyses due to the very small number identified (0.5 percent). Due to the small numbers of \nstudnets with special education needs, findings need to be interpreted with caution. The high special needs \ngroup in particular was too small to be considered nationally representative. \nAchievement in health and physical education \nAt both year levels, students with high or moderate special education needs tended to achieve at a lower \nlevel than those with no special education needs. However, the overlap between the groups indicated that \nthere were students, particularly those with moderate special education needs, who were achieving at the \nsame level as, or above students with no special education needs.  \nThe difference in average scale scores on the Critical Thinking in Health and Physical Educaton measure \nbetween Year 4 and Year 8 students with moderate special education needs was similar to that of Year 4 \nand Year 8 students with no special education needs. This indicates that a similar rate of progress was \nfound for both groups. \nAt Year 4, almost all students with moderate special education needs were achieving at Level 2 or above of \nthe NZC, similar to students with no special education needs. Overall, Year 4 students’ achievement \nexceeded the expectations expressed in the NZC. At Year 8, just over 40 percent of students with moderate \nspecial education needs were achieving at Level 4 or above of the NZC compared with 52 percent of All \nStudents. Overall, Year 8 student achievement was below the expectations expressed in the NZC. \nAttitudes to health and physical education, and opportunities to learn \nAverage scale scores for Attitude to Health decreased between Year 4 and Year 8 for students with no \nspecial education needs but not for students with moderate education needs. Average scores for Attitude to \nPhysical Education declined very little between Year 4 and Year 8 and differences were not statistically \nsignificant for any groups.  \nStudents with special education needs reported having a similar range of opportunities to learn health and \nphysical education as students with no special education needs.  \nBenchmarking success for studies with special education needs \nTwenty-eight percent of Year 4 students and 38 percent of Year 8 students with moderate special education \nneeds achieved above their respective national average compared to about 50 percent of All Students. \nThere was a slightly greater percentage of boys in the special education needs group compared with the All \nStudents group. This reflects the composition of the national sample of students with special education \nneeds. Students with special education needs who achieved above the national average benchmark tended \nto come from mid and high decile schools as was the case for All Students.  \nInclusion of students with special education needs in health and physical education \nAlmost all principals at both year levels rated their school’s inclusion of students with special education \nneeds in the health and physical education programme as good to excellent. \n  \n 106 Chapter 7: NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013 \n1. Students with special education learning needs in NMSSA \nThe study includes students with special education needs in the assessment programme.  \nParticipating schools identified students’ special education needs27 using the following categories:  \n• High: For example, ORS funded, Supplementary Learning Support, severe behaviour or \ncommunication assistance from Special Education \n• Moderate: For example, provided with a teacher aide from school funds, on the case load for \nResource Teachers: Learning and Behaviour (RTLB), or Child Youth and Family Services (CYFS) \n• On referral: For example, to Special Education or CYFS with action pending.  \nStudents not falling into any of the above categories were assigned to the ‘no special education needs’ group.  \nNo students on referral completed the health and physical education assessment at Year 4, with only one \nstudent doing so at Year 8. This number is lower than the 2012 NMSSA study, for which students on referral \nmade up 4 percent of the sample at both year levels. The lower number of students falling within the on \nreferral category for the health and physical education assessment was likely due to the timing and manner of \ncollecting the information from schools.28 The ‘on referral’ category is not discussed further in this chapter. \nStudents with special education needs were invited to participate using the level of assistance normally \nprovided to them. Schools and parents were able to withdraw any students for whom the experience of \nparticipating in NMSSA would be inappropriate. For example, a child may have been withdrawn if they \nhad: very high special education needs that could not be accommodated, anxiety, or behaviour issues.  \nThe assessment of health and physical education was undertaken using individual assessment approaches \n(one-to-one interviews and performance activities) delivered to approximately 770 students at each year \nlevel rather than a paper-and-pencil approach that is delivered to approximately 2,000 students. Therefore, \nfor students with special education needs this is less likely to be a nationally representative sample and the \nfindings are indicative only. This is particularly true with regard to the high special education needs group \nfrom which many of the special education needs student withdrawals are likely to have come. \nTable 7.1 and Table 7.2 display the Year 4 and Year 8 groups of students with special education needs who \ncompleted the Critical Thinking in Health and Physical Education measure by gender and decile. Although \nthe numbers of students with high special education needs were very small (0.5 percent of the sample), the \nnumber with moderate special education needs was larger and allowed analysis of achievement and some \ncomparison with the national sample. Students with moderate special education needs made up 7 percent of \nthe national sample at Year 4 and 5 percent at Year 8. Descriptive information about the achievement of \nstudents with high special education needs is reported in this chapter, but no comparative statistical \nanalyses are included due to the small numbers.  \nThere were approximately twice as many boys than girls with special education needs at both year levels. \nThe gender split for the ‘no special education needs’ group was more even at both year levels. At Year 4, \nstudents with special education needs came equally from schools across the three decile groups with \nslightly more coming from mid-decile schools at Year 8. This was similar to the group of students with no \nspecial education needs. \n \n                                                        \n27  The categories of special education needs were those common in schools and therefore easy for schools to respond to. Schools were \nasked to describe the funding supports in place for children with special education needs to access the curriculum, through ORS, SLS, \nRTLB, Ministry of Education specialist staff, and school funds. To capture any unmet needs they were also asked to note students who \nwere on referral to Ministry of Education specialist staff, RTLB etc. These categories were discussed and endorsed by the NMSSA \nspecial education needs reference group. \n28  In 2012 and 2013 the procedure asked schools to identify any students for whom participating in NMSSA would not be appropriate due \nto high special education needs (ORS funded), ESOL, Māori Immersion or the experience would be anxiety provoking. In 2012 after the \nschool visits to collect data, schools were asked to identify students who were ‘on referral’. In 2013 schools were asked to identify \nstudents who were on referral when the list of students to be included in the study was initially selected. There was also a change in the \nmethod of returning this information to NMSSA: in 2012 it was by email; in 2013 it was by email or online. \n NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013: Chapter 7 107 \nTable 7.1 Breakdown of Year 4 students with special education needs and no special education needs  \nby gender and decile school   All Gender Decile  N % Boys (N) Girls (N) Low (N) Mid (N) High (N) \nHigh special education needs 2 <1 1 1 2 0 0 \nModerate special education needs 53 7 36 17 17 18 18 \nOn referral 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \nNo special education needs 721 93 377 344 166 257 298 \nTotal 776 100 414 362 185 275 316 \nTable 7.2 Breakdown of Year 8 students with special education needs and no special education needs  \nby gender and decile school  All Gender Decile  N % Boys (N) Girls (N) Low (N) Mid (N) High (N) \nHigh special education needs 5 1 2 3 1 3 1 \nModerate special education needs 37 5 25 12 11 15 11 \nOn referral 1 <1 1 0 0 1 0 \nNo special education needs 719 94 350 369 151 342 226 \nTotal 762 100 378 384 163 361 238 \n2.

They typically were able to: \n• share their understandings, ideas, or viewpoints;  \n• identify factors that impact on well-being generally;  \n• and practices to support their well-being; \n• to recognise general health messages; \n• suggest general reasons for actions and reactions when people are responding to  \nproblems or issues; \n• participate in ball games.  \n 108 Chapter 7: NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013 \nA curriculum alignment exercise was undertaken to link performance ranges on the Critical Thinking in \nHealth and Physical Education scale to the NZC. Creating this link allows scale scores to be reported in \nterms of curriculum expectations. See Appendix 3. \nTable 7.4 shows that, for Critical Thinking in Health and Physical Education at Year 4, 96 percent of the 53 \nstudents with moderate special education needs achieved at Level 2 or above, similar to that of students \nwho had no special education needs. This exceeded the NZC expectations for Year 4 students. \nTable 7.4 Percentage of Year 4 students with different special education needs achieving at the NZC level 2 on the \nCritical Thinking in health and PE measure \n Critical Thinking in Health and PE \n High Special Education Needs (N=2) \nModerate Special \nEducation Needs (N=53) \nNo special education \nneeds (N=721) \nLevel 2 and above  * 96 97 \nNot yet Level 2  * 4 3 \n* There were too few students with high education needs to report. \nTable 7.5 displays the differences in scale score units between the students with moderate special education \nneeds and those with no special education needs at Year 4.

Forty-one percent of students with \nmoderate special education needs achieved at Level 4 or above compared with 52 percent of students with \nno special education needs. Overall, Year 8 students were achieving below the expectations expressed in \nthe NZC for Year 8. \nTable 7.7 Percentage of Year 8 students with different special education needs achieving at the NZC level 4 on the \nCritical Thinking in health and PE measure \n Critical Thinking in Health and PE \n High Special Education Needs (N=5) \nModerate Special \nEducation Needs \n( ) \nNo Special Education \nNeeds (N=719) \nLevel 4 and above  * 41 52 \nNot yet Level 4  * 59 48 \n* There were too few students with high education needs to report. \nTable 7.8 compares the difference in scale scores (and the associated effect sizes) between students at Year \n8 with moderate and no special education needs.

The very small numbers of high \nspecial education needs students have been \nexcluded from comparisons with other \ngroups in this section.  \nOn average, Year 8 students with moderate  \nand no special education needs had higher \nachievement scores than the corresponding \nstudents at Year 4. However, similar to All \nStudents, there was notable overlap in the \nachievement between the Year 4 and Year 8 \nsamples.  \nTable 7.9 displays the differences between \nYear 4 and Year 8 achievement and the \nassociated effect sizes for the different \ncategories of special education needs. This \ntable details the difference in average \nscores between one cohort of students at \nYear 4 and another at Year 8. We use this \ndifference to provide an estimate of \nprogress between these year levels. It must \nbe noted that this is not a measure of actual \nprogress by a particular group of students.  \nThe scale score differences between Year 4 \nand Year 8 students in the moderate and no \nspecial education needs groups were 26 and \n23 scale score units respectively. The \ndifferences represented average annual \neffect sizes of 0.35 and 0.28, indicating that \nstudents with moderate special education \nneeds were progressing on average from \nYear 4 to Year 8 at least as well as those \nwith no special education needs.  \n \n \nFigure 7.1  Achievement of Year 4 students with special \neducation needs for Critical Thinking in Health \nand PE \n \n Figure 7.2  Achievement of Year 8 students with special \neducation needs for Critical Thinking in Health \nand PE \nNote: In Figures 7.1 and 7.2 the box and whisker plots for students with \nhigh special education needs are atypical (no whiskers in Figure 7.1, and \nno lower box in Figure 7.2) are due to the very small numbers of students \nin these categories. \n  \n NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013: Chapter 7 111 \nTable 7.9 Difference in health and PE achievement by category of special education needs and no special  \neducation needs  \n Difference between Year 4 and Year 8 on  Critical Thinking in Health and PE \n Difference  \n(scale score units) \nEffect Size Annual Average Effect \nSize \nHigh special education needs 19 * * \nModerate special education needs 26 1.41 0.35 \nNo special education needs 23 1.13 0.28 \nEffect sizes in bold are statistically significant (p<.05) \n* Effect size is not reported for the high special education group due to the small sample size \n5.

Table 7.10 reports the Year 4 and Year 8 differences in \nattitude scores between the year levels for these groups of students.  \nThe average Attitude to Health score was similar for students with high and no special education needs at \nYear 4, and across all categories at Year 8. At Year 4, students with moderate special education needs had a \nslightly lower average Attitude to Health score.  \nIn general Attitude to Health declined between Year 4 and Year 8.

Opportunities to learn health and physical education \nStudents were asked to identify how often they experienced a range of health and physical education \nlearning activities at school. The pattern and frequency of learning experiences reported by students was \nvery similar in the groups with moderate and with no special education needs. Appendix 6 shows the \ndistribution of responses for these two groups.  \nIn health at Year 4, the most frequently reported opportunities to learn were ‘learning something that is \nimportant to me’ and ‘taking action to improve my health after learning something in class’, both of which \nwere reported as occurring ‘quite a lot’ or ‘heaps’ by more than 60 percent of both moderate and no special \neducation needs students. In Year 8 the same two opportunities were most frequently reported, but by a \nslightly lower proportion of students.  \nIn physical education, at both Year 4 and Year 8, over 70 percent of students with moderate and no special \neducation needs reported frequent opportunities to learn in all aspects except for ‘having challenges like \nmaking up movement patterns or solving problems’, where it was reported by 60 percent of students.  \nIn general, opportunities to learn physical education were reported to occur more frequently than \nopportunities to learn health at both year levels and across all groups. \n8. Benchmarking success for students with special education needs  \nThe 2013 national average served as a benchmark for comparing the results of the different groups. It may \nalso be used to compare health and physical education results from future cycles of NMSSA assessment. \nThis section contrasts the profiles of Year 4 and Year 8 students with different groups of students with \nspecial education needs who scored above the benchmark on the Critical Thinking in Health and Physical \nEducation scale at their respective year level. They are compared with the group of All Students who also \nscored above the respective Year 4 and Year 8 benchmarks.  \nTable 7.12 shows the number and percentage of Year 4 students with special education needs who scored \nabove the Year 4 benchmark and the level and spread of their scores. At Year 4, 28 percent of students with \nmoderate special education needs and no students with high special education needs scored above the \nbenchmark in contrast to 53 percent of All Students.  \n  \n 114 Chapter 7: NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013 \nTables 7.13 shows the equivalent Year 8 analysis. One of the six students with high special education needs \nin the sample achieved above the Year 8 benchmark. Thirty-eight percent of students with moderate special \neducation needs also achieved above the benchmark, a greater proportion than in the Year 4 sample, in \ncontrast to 50 percent of All Students.  \nTable 7.12 Summary statistics for Year 4 students by categories of special education needs and All Students scoring \nabove the Year 4 benchmark  \n Year 4 students scoring above the Year 4 benchmark \n Number \nabove benchmark \n(total group) \nPercentage (%) \nof respective \ngroup \nAverage* \n(scale score \nunits) \nSD* \n(scale score \nunits) \nHigh special education needs 0 (2) 0 \n101 9 \nModerate special education needs 15 (53) 28 \nAll Students 410 (776) 53 104 11 \n*The groups of students with high and moderate special education needs have been combined \nTable 7.13 Summary statistics for Year 8 students by categories of special education needs and All Students scoring \nabove the Year 8 benchmark  \n Year 8 students scoring above the Year 8 benchmark \n Number \nabove benchmark \n(total group) \nPercentage (%) \nof respective \ngroup \nAverage* \n(scale score \nunits) \nSD* \n(scale score units) \nHigh special education needs 1 (6) 17 \n120 8 \nModerate special education needs 14 (37) 38 \nAll Students 381 (762) 50 127 12 \n*The groups of students with high and moderate special education needs have been combined \nFigures 7.5 and 7.6 contrast the profiles of students with special education needs who scored above the \nbenchmark with those of All Students, by gender, Attitude to Health, Attitude to Physical Education and \nschool decile. At each year level the profile of above benchmark special education needs groups was \ncreated by combining the groups of students with high and moderate special education needs. This step was \nnecessary because of the small number of students in the individual categories.  \nFor those achieving above the benchmark at both year levels there were proportionately more boys than \ngirls in the special education needs group. This reflects the proportion of boys and girls in the national \nsamples of students with special needs. This contrasted with an even split for All Students achieving above \nthe benchmark. A majority of students with special education needs scoring above the benchmark came \nfrom mid or high decile schools at Year 4 (100 percent) and Year 8 (73 percent); a similar pattern to the \ngroup of All Students.  \nYear 4 above benchmark students with special education needs came almost equally from mid and high decile \nschools. However, Tables 7.1 and 7.2 indicate that the whole sample of students with special education needs \nwere equally spread across low, mid and high decile schools. This suggests that students with special \neducation needs in low decile schools were under-represented in those who scored above the benchmark.  \nAt Year 8, more than half of the students with special education needs in the sample came from mid decile \nschools, with the remainder coming more from low rather than high decile schools. Again, the proportion \nof students with special education needs attending mid decile schools scoring above the benchmark was \ngreater than that of All Students (Table 7.2). \n NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013: Chapter 7 115 \n \nFigure 7.5 Year 4: Percentage of students with special education needs (SEN) and All Students \nscoring above the benchmark in Critical Thinking in Health and PE by gender, Attitude \nto Health, Attitude to PE, and school decile \n \nFigure 7.6 Year 8: Percentage of students with special education needs (SEN) and All Students \nscoring above the benchmark in Critical Thinking in Health and PE by gender, Attitude \nto Health, Attitude to PE, and school decile \nAt least 25 percent of the above benchmark special education needs group fell within the lowest Attitude to \nHealth and Attitude to Physical Education categories at both Year 4 and Year 8. At Year 4 those with the \nlowest Attitude to Health made up over half of the above benchmark group. In both years and for both \nattitude measures the above benchmark special education needs group had a greater proportion within the \nlowest attitude category than the All Students group. \n  \n 116 Chapter 7: NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013 \n9. Inclusion of students with special education needs in health  \nand physical education  \nPrincipals were asked to provide an overall rating of their school’s inclusion of students with special \neducation needs in the health and physical education programme. Figure 7.7 shows that over 70 percent of \nprincipals at both Year 4 and Year 8 rated their inclusion practices as very good or excellent. About 20 \npercent rated them as good and less than five percent at either year level rated them as fair or poor. \n  \nFigure 7.7  Principals’ rating of their school’s inclusion of students with special \neducation needs in the health and PE programme by year level \n NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013: Appendix 1 117 \nAppendix 1:  \nNational Monitoring Study of Student Achievement \n2013 \n1. Samples for 2013  \nA two-stage sampling design was used to select nationally representative samples of students at Year 4 \nand at Year 8. The first stage involved sampling schools, and the second step involved sampling students \nwithin schools. \nA stratified random sampling approach was taken with the intention of selecting 100 schools at Year 4 and \n100 schools at Year 8. Twenty-eight students were randomly selected from each school with three being \navailable as reserves. From that list 25 students made up a sample of approximately 2000 students at Year 4 \nand 2000 students at Year 8.  \nTo select the Year 4 and Year 8 students for 2013, the MoE 2012 school returns for Year 3 and Year 7 \nrespectively were used.  \n2. Sampling of schools \nSampling algorithm \nFrom the complete list of NZ schools select two datasets – one for Year 3 students and the other for Year 7 \nstudents.  \nFor the Year 3 sample: \n• Exclude: \no Schools which have fewer than 8 Year 3 students  \no Private schools \no Special schools \no Correspondence School \no Kura Kaupapa Māori. \n• Stratify the sampling frame by region and quintile.29 \n• Within each region-by-quintile stratum, order the schools by Year 3 roll size.30 \n• Arrange the strata alternately in increasing and decreasing order of roll size.31 \n• Select a random starting point. \n• From the random starting point, cumulate the Year 3 roll. \n• Because 100 schools are required in the sample, the sampling interval is calculated as \n  –  Total number of Year 3 students / 100  \n• Assign each school to a \"selection group\" using this calculation: \no Selection group = ceiling (cumulative roll/sampling interval). \n• Select the first school in each selection group to form the final sample. \nFollow the same process for the Year 7 sample.  \n                                                        \n29  Decile 1 and 2 comprises Quintile 1; Decile 3 and 4 comprises Quintile 2;  Decile 5 and 6 comprises Quintile 3; Decile 7 and 8 \ncomprises Quintile 4; and Decile 9 and 10 comprises Quintile 5. \n30  Roll size refers to the year level in question e.g.  roll size for Year 3 students \n31  This is done so that when replacements are made across stratum boundaries the replacement school is of a similar size to the one it is \nreplacing. \n 118 Appendix 1: NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013 \nIf a school is selected in both the Year 3 and Year 7 samples, randomly assign it to one of the two samples. \nLocate the school in the unassigned sample and select a replacement school (next on list). Repeat the \nprocess for each school selected in both samples. \nThe 2013 NMSSA sample  \nThe sample frames constituted 1476 schools for Year 3 and 946 schools for Year 7 after exclusions had \nbeen applied. No schools were listed in both samples.  \nSelected schools were invited to participate. Those that declined to participate were substituted using  \nthe following procedure: \n• from overall school sample frame, select school one row below the school withdrawn; \n• verify that the substitute school is of similar type, decile, size; \n• if this school is not available, re-select by going to one row above the school withdrawn.  \nverify profile;  \n• if this school is not available, select school two rows below the school withdrawn. Continue in this \nsequence until a substitute is found. \nIn total, 61 schools (21 at Year 4 and 40 at Year 8) declined to participate. Replacement schools were \nfound for all. One Year 8 school withdrew two days prior to their visit date due to school merger issues.  \nThe achieved samples of schools  \nThe participation rate of schools before substitution was 83 percent at Year 4 and 71 percent at Year 8. \nAfter substitution, the achieved sample of 100 schools at Year 4 represented a participation rate32 of  \n85 percent; and the achieved sample of 99 schools at Year 8 represented a response rate of 83 percent33. \n3. Sampling of students \nAfter schools agreed to participate in the programme, they were asked to provide a list of all Year 4  \n(or Year 8) students, identifying any students for whom the experience would be inappropriate (e.g. high \nspecial needs (ORS), very limited English language (ESOL), Māori Immersion Level 1, would be absent \nduring the visit, had left the school, other health or behavioural issues, e.g. anxiety). The procedure for \nselecting students for the group-administered sample and the individual sample was as follows: \n• each school provided a list of all students in their school at Year 4 or Year 8 in 2013. The lists were \narranged in the order as provided by the school (that is alphabetically by last name). A computer-\ngenerated random number between 1 and 1,000,000 was assigned to each student. Students were \nranked by their random number from highest to lowest;  \n• the first 28 non-excluded students in the ordered list were identified as belonging to the group-\nadministered sample. The first eight students were identified as also belonging to the individual \nsample. Where there were more than 25 students in a year level, up to three students next on the list \nwere selected as ‘reserves’ for potential replacements if required; \n• the draft school lists of selected students were returned to schools for approval. Principals and \nteachers identified inappropriate students if they had omitted to do so at the first stage. These \nstudents were replaced with students up to number 28 from the initial rankings, resulting in a \nconfirmed list. Letters of consent were sent to these students’ parents;  \n• the children of parents who declined to have their child participate were withdrawn from the list. \n  \n                                                        \n32  School participation rate is defined as the number of schools that participated (the achieved sample) as a percentage of the number of \nschools required (those invited plus replacements). \n \n NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013: Appendix 1 119 \n• prior to the start of school visits, withdrawn students were not replaced unless they had been omitted \nto be identified at the first stage, in which case the student with the next rank on the school’s student \nsample list was included. Students continued to be replaced (only if an originally selected student \nwas withdrawn) up until two weeks prior to teacher assessors (TAs) arriving in schools to conduct \nthe assessments. This time schedule was put in place as any later withdrawals meant we would not \nhave had sufficient time to advise parents of substitute students;. \n• on the day before arrival in each school, TAs checked the final student list;   \n• on-site replacements of students by TAs were made if: \no any of students 1 – 8 (the individual sample) were absent or withdrawn (e.g. by principal) \non the first day, prior to the start of assessments. They were replaced according to \nethnicity / gender criteria; \no all other students (up to 28) participated in group-administered assessments. However,  \na maximum of 25 booklets from each school was included in the results; \no if students were absent or withdrawn (e.g. by principal) after the start of the assessment \nprogramme, no replacements were made. \nThe achieved samples of students at Year 4  \nTable A1.1 shows that at Year 4 the intended sample was 2173 randomly selected students. Principals \nidentified 122 students for whom the experience would be unsuitable. The ‘eligible’ sample was reduced to \n2051. Substitutions were selected for 63 students, and 164 students either withdrew late, were absent or \nmade non-responses during the assessment period. The achieved group-administered sample included 2087 \nstudents representing a participation rate of 88 percent. \nThe achieved individual sample included 790 students representing a participation rate of 98 percent. \nThe combined school and student participation rates for the two samples were 74 percent and  \n83 percent respectively.  \nTable A1.2 contrasts the characteristics of the samples with the population.  \nTable A1.1 Selection of Year 4 students for the group-administered (GAP)  \nand individual samples \n  GAP - N Individual - N \nIntended sample of students 2173 800 \nStudents withdrawn by principal before sample selected 122 5 \nEligible sample 2051 795 \nStudents withdrawn by parents or principal after sampling 103 5 \nSupplement students used 63 5 \nStudents for whom there were no substitutes 0 - \nLate withdrawals 1 - \nAbsences/non responses during assessment period 163 - \nAchieved sample 2087 790 \n  \n 120 Appendix 1: NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013 \nTable A1.2 Comparison of group-administered (GAP) and individual samples with population characteristics \n at Year 4 \n Population  \n(%) \nGroup-administered \nsample  \nn = 2087* (%) \nIndividual sample  \nn = 790* (%) \n    Gender    \nBoys 51 51 53 \nGirls 49 49 47 \nEthnicity**    \nEuropean 63 64 62 \nMāori 23 20 21 \nPasifika 12 12 13 \nAsian 11 12 13 \nOther 3 3 3 \nSchool Quintile    \n1-2 17 14 15 \n3-4 16 17 18 \n5-6 18 17 17 \n7-8 20 18 20 \n9-10 29 34 30 \nSchool Type    \nContributing (Year 1-6) 61 62 59 \nFull Primary (Year 1-8) 36 35 38 \nComposite (Year 1-13) 3 3 3 \nMOE Region    \nCentral North 21 22 23 \nCentral South 18 19 19 \nNorthern 40 39 37 \nSouthern 21 20 21 \n(Note that rounding to integers means that percentages do not always add up to 100 percent) \n* Some students responses were excluded because their assessment data was not able to be used (e.g. too few questions were  \nattempted to be able to be a reliable estimate of their achievement, or the video taped response was inaudible). \n** Percentages for ethnic groupings do not add to 100%.

Investigating weighting the NMSSA 2013 sample \nA post-hoc investigation was carried out to determine whether or not weights should be applied to the \nNMSSA 2013 sample.  \nSample weights can be used to correct for misrepresentation in the sample. In NMSSA 2013 weights were \ncalculated with respect to gender, decile (represented by quintile), and ethnicity. Non-prioritised ethnicity \nvariables were used. That is, each sample member's ethnicity was denoted by five binary variables, with the \npossibility of identifying with multiple groups.  \nFor each sample member five weights (one for each possible ethnic identification) were calculated as: \n• PN(gender) * PN(quintile) * PN(ethnic group) / PS(gender) * PS(quintile) * PS(ethnic group) \n• where ethnic group could be one of NZ European, Māori, Pasifika, Asian, and Other \nThe subscripts 'N' and 'S' denote national level probabilities and sample probabilities respectively.  \nA final weight, taking the average of the five weights was applied. \nDistribution of final weights \nTable A1.5 shows the distribution of final weights for each sample.  \nTable A1.5 - Distribution of final weights for each sample \nFinal weights \n Year 4 Year 8 \nAverage 1.00 1.00 \nMinimum 0.86 0.82 \n25th percentile 0.89 0.88 \n50th percentile 0.96 0.92 \n75th percentile 1.09 1.09 \nMaximum 1.23 1.43 \n \nThere were no extreme weights, and the distributions for both year level samples are reasonably closely \nclustered around 1.00. This indicates that in general the selected sample was representative of the national \npopulation. A decision was taken not to apply weights to these samples. \n 124 Appendix 2: NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013 \nAppendix 2: \nAssessment Framework for the NMSSA Health  \nand Physical Education Programme \n \nTask Title Strand Key Learning Area Sub/constructs Assessment \nApproach \nAn Important \nMessage* \nHealthy Communities & \nEnvironments \nBody Care & \nPhysical Safety \nCritical thinking \nCritical action \nCreative thinking \nPaper-and-pencil/ \nInterview \nWater Safety* Personal Health &  \nPhysical Development \nHealthy Communities & \nEnvironments \nBody Care & \nPhysical Safety \nOutdoor Education \nCritical thinking \nCritical action \nInterview \nNew School*  Relationships with other \nPeople \nMental Health \nSexuality \nCritical thinking \nCreative thinking \nInterview \nMagazine Ads* Personal Health &  \nPhysical Development \nMental Health \nSexuality  \nBody Care & \nPhysical Safety \nCritical thinking Interview \nFair Play*  Relationships with other \nPeople \nMental Health \nSports Studies \nCritical thinking \nCritical action \nInterview \nEating Together* Personal Health and \nPhysical Development \nHealthy Communities & \nEnvironments \nFood and Nutrition Critical thinking \nCreative thinking \nInterview \nRippa Tag* (1 item) \n** \nMovement Concepts & \nMotor Skills \nPhysical Activity Critical thinking \nCreative thinking \nActivity \nRua Tapawhā*** Movement Concepts & \nMotor Skills \nRelationships with other \nPeople \nPhysical Activity Critical thinking \nCritical action \nCreative thinking \nActivity/Interview \nMovement \nSequences**** \nMovement Concepts & \nMotor Skills \nPhysical Activity Fundamental \nmovement skills \nActivity \nWell-being***** Personal Health &  \nPhysical Development \nMovement concepts and \nMotor Skills \nMental Health  \nPhysical Activity \nCritical thinking \nCritical action \nPaper-and-pencil/ \nInterview \n*   Formed the scale of Critical Thinking in Health and Physical Education  \n**   Movement Skills including (but not limited to) rotation, agility, and balance, along with strategic action skills \n***   Movement Skills including (but not limited to) throwing, catching, defensive tracking, and sstrategic action skills \n****  Movement Skills including (but not limited to) control of equipment, change of level and pace, use of body and space \n*****  Understanding of Well-being \n \n NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013: Appendix 3 125 \nAppendix 3: \nCurriculum Alignment of the Critical Thinking  \nin Health and Physical Education Scale \nA curriculum alignment exercise was carried out for the part of the health and physical education \nassessment that addressed critical thinking in health and physical education. An achievement scale (Critical \nThinking in Health and Physical Education) was constructed using students' responses to interview \nquestions designed to probe their ability to think critically within a variety of contexts. \nThe alignment of an achievement scale with health and physical education in the NZC has not been \nattempted before. Consequently, the process for NMSSA 2013 involved some experimentation and some \ntrial and error. Thorough discussions with experts in the field were held about the nature of the learning \narea and how it can be interpreted, how the learning area is presented to students at school, and what \nstudent achievement looks like in this learning area. \nA panel of subject matter experts came together for a day's workshop to study and discuss the interview \ntasks, the scoring ‘rubrics, and students' responses in detail. The concept of ‘minimal competence’ at \nparticular curriculum levels was also discussed at length.  \nPanel members were asked to think about what students who were achieving at a minimal curriculum level of 2 \n(or 4) would be able to achieve on each NMSSA task. This part of the alignment relied on the panel members \nbeing very familiar, in a practical sense, with students' learning in health and physical education, and \nunderstanding the sorts of competencies students at this level would be able to exhibit in the NMSSA assessment.  \nFor each of the tasks involved, each panel member answered the question:  \n• What would a minimally competent student at Level 2 (or 4) score on this task? \nFrom the panel's answers to this question a 'profile' of the minimally competent student could be built up, \nand finally converted to a scale score.  \nThere were some challenges for the panel in completing this exercise:  \n• The NZC in health and physical education provides rather broad descriptions of achievement. \nSpecific contexts for study are not provided, and descriptions of developing skills sets at different \nlevels are open to interpretation.  \n• Unlike other aspects of learning areas (such as reading, writing, and mathematics) health and \nphysical education is often presented in short units of learning contexts, and not as an everyday \nlearning contexts. Students may only be assessed with respect to the learning area after a year's \nworth of experiences in health and physical education.  \n• Panel members noted that classroom assessment in health and physical education would often be \nassociated with a short unit of learning contexts, and an ensuing assessment would be generally \nrelevant to students' recent experiences. In the NMSSA interview situation, students were \npresented with contexts they might or might not have been recently exposed to.  \n  \n 126 Appendix 3: NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013 \nThere were also some challenges for students in the interview assessment: \n• The interview questions were, of necessity, less relevant than they would have been if they had \nbeen related to a recent classroom context for learning.  \n• Students were required to answer questions on the spot. There was little time for discussion, and \nopportunities for prompting were limited because of time allocations. There were limited \nopportunities for students to consider, or re-consider, responses to questions. \n• Students were interacting on a one-to-one basis with an unfamiliar person. It is not uncommon for \nstudents to be assessed in a group situation in a classroom environment - a class discussion for \ninstance. Some students may have found the one-to-one mode of assessment difficult. \nGiven the difficulties in interpretation of the NZC and the difficulty in applying the concept of 'minimal \ncompetence' in this learning area, a second session was organised to confirm the first alignment. After \ncareful deliberation some adjustments were made to the initial alignment to render the final result for \nNMSSA 2013, shown in Table A3.1.  It is important to regard these results as point estimates with inherent \nerror. However, it is impossible to assess the precise amount of error involved. As a consequence, graphics \nin the report have been presented with shading around curriculum cut-points to remind the reader that \nsubstantial error could be involved.  \nThe point estimates for curriculum cut-points will stand in good stead to be used for comparative purposes \nin the next NMSSA cycle involving health and physical education. \nTable A3.1:  Final cut-off score points out the Critical  \nThinking in Health and PE scale \n \nCritical Thinking in Health and PE scale location \nLevel 2 43.1 \nLevel 3 76.4 \nLevel 4 109.8 \n NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013: Appendix 4 127 \n Appendix 4: \nSub-group Analyses Summary \nNote: Effect sizes and the confidence intervals are directional; that is, they are either negative or positive. \nThe direction of the effect sizes reported in this appendix may differ from what is reported in the tables in \nthe body of the report.

For example, in Table 1.2 of this appendix \nthe effect size for the difference in Year 4 average scale scores for students in low vs mid decile groups \n(Low/Mid) is reported as 0.60. Students in low decile schools scored lower than students in mid decile \nschools (77 vs 89).

Decile: \nRegression Analysis \nReporting on differences between groups of students in New Zealand by ethnicity is a complex matter. \nAnalysis is complicated on two counts. First, as mentioned in the main part of the report, a high proportion \nof Māori and Pasifika students attend lower decile schools, and a much lower proportion attend high decile \nschools. This situation inflicts a skew on the distribution of all ethnic sub-groups with respect to decile. An \nadded problem in the health and physical education analysis is that we already start with a reduced sample \n(8 students in each school were selected for the health and physical education assessment), and sample \nsizes are then further reduced when we looked at sub-groups. The limit on sample numbers makes it \nimpossible to estimate model parameters with a high level of precision. \nThe second complication is that students may identify with more than one ethnic group. It is difficult to \nmake useful, robust statistical statements with respect to performance in ethnicity sub- groups when there is \nsubstantial 'blurring' with regard to group membership.  \nTo explore the performance of ethnic groups on the Critical Thinking in Health and Physical Education \nmeasure across deciles the following regression analyses were carried out: \n• a comparison of Māori and NZ European students' critical thinking outcomes  \n• a comparison of Pasifika and NZ European students' critical thinking outcomes  \nFor the purposes of the analysis decile was coded to quintile.34. \nIn all cases, there was a strong (statistically significant) quintile effect. Average scores increased \nconsistently with quintile.  \nThe results from this analysis should be interpreted with caution. The model's ability to precisely assess \nhow Māori or Pasifika students are performing, on average, in higher decile schools (and how NZ \nEuropean students are performing in lower decile schools) is compromised by the disproportionate \nnumbers of students in those deciles in the national sample with respect to their ethnicity.  \nFor each year level and for both Māori and Pasifika sub-groups, separate models were run to examine the \neffect on performance outcomes due to quintile and ethnicity.  \nFinal Māori model: \nAt each of Year 4 and Year 8, the following model was found to be the most parsimonious in the context of \nthe variables of interest.  \nFor student i \nCritical Thinking in Health and Physical Education scorei F = α + β1i*quintile +β2i*Māori + β3i*NZE + \nerrori \nwhere quintile, Māori, and NZE are all classification ('dummy') variables.  \nStudents with dual ethnicity were identified under both 'Māori' and 'NZE' classifications.  \nThe R2 statistic, indicating the proportion of variance in the Critical Thinking in Health and Physical \nEducation scores accounted for by the model was 0.11 at both Year 4 and 0.10 at Year 8. That is, 10-11  \npercent of the variance in the KAMSI scores for Māori and NZ European students could be accounted for \nby quintile and ethnicity.  \n                                                        \n34  Decile 1-2  Quintile 1, Decile 3-4  Quintile 2, … , Decile 9-10  Quintile 5 \n  \nNMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013: Appendix 5 159 \nModels with additional interaction terms were considered, but showed no significant improvement over the \nmain effects model specified above. Models were compared using the usual F-test where the hypotheses are: \n H0: reduced model is adequate \n HA: full model is better \nThen = � 𝐷𝑟𝑜𝑝 𝑖𝑛 𝑆𝑆𝐸𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑎𝑑𝑑𝑒𝑑 𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑚𝑠�\n𝑆2𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑓𝑢𝑙𝑙 𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙  , where SSE = Sum of the squared residuals in the respective model \nFinal Pasifika model: \nAt each of Year 4 and Year 8, the following model was found to be the most parsimonious in the context of \nthe variables of interest.  \nFor student i \nCritical Thinking in Health and Physical Education scorei F = α + β1i*quintile +β2i*Pasifika + β3i*NZE + \nerrori \nwhere quintile, Pasifika, and NZE are all classification ('dummy') variables. \nSimilar to the Māori model, students with both Pasifika and NZ European ethnicity were identified under \nboth classifications in the model.  \nThe R2 statistic, indicating the proportion of variance in the Critical Thinking in Health and Physical \nEducation scores accounted for by the model was 0.17 at both Year 4 and Year 8.  \nAs with the Māori models, no improvement was made at either year level when interaction terms were \nadded to the Pasifika models.  \nSummary: \nIn all cases, the models showed that there was an effect due to ethnicity which remained after accounting \nfor the quintile effect. That is, there was a difference in average critical thinking scores between each ethnic \nsub-group and NZ European students over and above the difference accounted for by quintile. This \ndifference was constant (as far as the model could determine) across all quintiles.  \nFigures A5.1 to A5.4 show critical thinking scores by decile. Ethnic group membership is shown by using \ndifferent symbols. Average scores for each group are shown using dotted lines and symbols. The variation \nin scores at each quintile is considerable. Despite there being differences, on average, between the Māori \nand Pasifika groups and the NZ European groups, there are many students in low decile schools scored \nhigher in the health and physical education than students in high decile schools.  \nAt Year 4, the modelled scale scores show that on average Māori students scored nine scale score units \nlower than NZ European students (Table A5.1 and Figure A5.1), and at Year 8, seven scale score units \nlower (Table A5.2 and Figure A5.2) \n  \n 160 Appendix 5: NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013 \n \n \n \nTable A5.1 Year 4: Modelled averages on the Critical Thinking in Health and  \nPhysical Education scale by quintile and ethnicity \nQuintile NZE Māori \n1 82 73 \n2 89 80 \n3 93 84 \n4 93 84 \n5 97 88 \n \n \nFigure A5.1  Year 4 NZ European and Māori students' Critical Thinking in Health and PE scores  \nby quintile \n \n \n  \n  \nNMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013: Appendix 5 161 \n \n \n \nTable A5.2 Year 8: Modelled averages on the Critical Thinking in Health and Physical Education scale by quintile and \nethnicity \nQuintile NZE Māori \n1 110 102 \n2 110 103 \n3 114 107 \n4 116 109 \n5 122 115 \n \n \nFigure A5.2 Year 8 NZ European and Māori students' Critical Thinking in Health and PE \nscores by quintile \n \n  \n 162 Appendix 5: NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013 \nAt Year 4, the modelled scale scores showed that on average Pasifika students scored 15 scale score units \nlower than NZ European students (Table A5.3 and Figure A5.3), and at Year 8, 14 scale score units lower \n(Table A5.4 and Figure A5.4). \nTable A5.3  Year 4: Modelled averages on the Critical Thinking in Health and Physical Education scale by quintile and \nethnicity \nQuintile NZE Pasifika \n1 85 70 \n2 88 74 \n3 92 77 \n4 93 78 \n5 97 82 \n \n \nFigure A5.3 Year 4 NZ European and Pasifika students' Critical Thinking in Health and PE scores \nby quintile \n \n \n  \n  \nNMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013: Appendix 5 163 \n \n \n \nTable A5.4  Year 8: Modelled averages on the Critical Thinking in Healthand PE scale by quintile and ethnicity \nQuintile NZE Pasifika \n1 107 93 \n2 113 98 \n3 114 99 \n4 117 102 \n5 122 108 \n \n \nFigure A5.4 Year 8 NZ European and Pasifika students' Critical Thinking in Health and PE scores  \nby quintile \n \n \n 164 Appendix 6: NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013 \nAppendix 6: \nOpportunities to Learn Health and Physical \nEducation for Students at Year 4 and Year 8 With \nModerate and No Special Education Needs \n \nFigure A6.1 Year 4 - Opportunities to learn health for students with moderate special education needs  \n \n \nFigure A6.2 Year 4 - Opportunities to learn health for students with no special education needs \n \n  \n NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013: Appendix 6 165 \n \n \n \nFigure A6.3 Year 8 - Opportunities to learn health for students with moderate special education needs \n \n \nFigure A6.4 Year 8 - Opportunities to learn health for students with no special education needs \n \n  \n 166 Appendix 6: NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013 \n \n \n \nFigure A6.5  Year 4 - Opportunities to learn PE for students with moderate special education needs \n \n \nFigure A6.6 Year 4 - Opportunities to learn PE for students with no special education needs \n  \n NMSSA Health and Physical Education 2013: Appendix 6 167 \n \n \n \nFigure A6.7  Year 8 - Opportunities to learn PE for students with moderate special education needs  \n \n \nFigure A6.8  Year 8 - Opportunities to learn PE for students with no special education needs \n \n \n",
