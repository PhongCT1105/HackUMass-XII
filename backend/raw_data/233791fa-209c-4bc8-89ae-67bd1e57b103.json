    "Abstract": "In this activity students try to identify the best time of year and place to position spotters to see possible tornado outbreaks. In order to do so they study a graphic that depicts the mean number of days per century with at least one F2 or greater tornado touching down. They then follow the instructions on their handouts and present their information using a poster, a mockup of a newspaper, a multimedia presentation, or a play. The site provides the required handouts and suggestions for extensions. Educational levels: High school, Middle school",
