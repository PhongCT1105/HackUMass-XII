Globally allergic rhin-\nitis constitutes a worldwide public health problem with a\nprevalence of 10% to 40% and the trend is increasing\n[2-5]. About 20 to 40 million people in the United States\nalone are estimated to be affected, [6] with 3.5 million\nlost workdays and 2 million lost schooldays annually [1].\nLocal population-based studies have reported a preva-\nlence of allergic rhinitis of 44% in Singaporean school\nchildren [7]. In UK intermittent allergic rhinitis (also\nknown as seasonal allergic rhinitis or hay fever affects up\nto 30% of adults and 40% of children at some time in\ntheir lives [8].\nAllergic rhinitis is associated with significant co-\nmorbidities and health care costs [9] and has been\n* Correspondence: drphillipoleo@yahoo.com\n†Equal contributors\n1Department of Surgery, Catholic University of Health and Allied Sciences\nBugando, Mwanza, Tanzania\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n© 2012 Said et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

The total burden of allergic rhin-\nitis lies on impaired physical and social functioning and\nalso in a financial burden for treatment of its co-morbid\ndiseases [1]. Allergic rhinitis commonly causes sleep dis-\nturbance, fatigue, listlessness irritability, and poor con-\ncentration leading to developmental delay, impaired\nlearning ability and poor school performance in children\n[11-14]. Socially unacceptable behavior such as sniffing,\nsneezing, noisy breathing and coughing may lead to iso-\nlation and rejection at school and home. Further morbid-\nity results from associated conditions such as sinusitis,\nadenoids, tonsil hypertrophy and otitis media [11].\nTime trend studies of the prevalence of allergies in\nAfrica show a consistent increase over a period of\n7–10 years [15]. In South African epidemiological data\nare scarce but the overall prevalence of allergic rhinitis in\nchildren is at least 20% to 24% and there is evidence of\nincreasing prevalence [11]. In Tanzania the data con-\ncerning allergic rhinitis are limited. Observation from\nBugando Medical centre E.N.T clinical records reveals\nthat allergic rhinitis and its associated co morbidities are\ncommon problem encountered with increasing trend for\nthe past three years. Despite adverse sequalae, allergic\nrhinitis remains unrecognized and miss managed condi-\ntion. Further more many patients do not recognize aller-\ngic rhinitis as a disease and therefore do not consult a\nphysician [16].\nThe aim of this study was to describe our experience\non allergic rhinitis, associated co-morbidities and treat-\nment outcome among patient attending Bugando Med-\nical Centre. Early identification of patient with allergic\nrhinitis and its co-morbidities would suggest develop-\nment of guideline for early detection and proper treat-\nment of allergic rhinitis and so reduce development of\nco-morbidities.\nMethods\nStudy design and setting\nThis was a descriptive prospective hospital-based study\nof patients with clinical Allergic rhinitis carried out at\nBugando Medical Centre in Northwestern Tanzania over\na period of three months from July to September 2011.\nBugando Medical Centre is located in Mwanza city\nalong the shore of Lake Victoria in the northwestern\npart of Tanzania. It is a tertiary care and teaching hos-\npital for the Catholic University of Health and Allied\nSciences- Bugando (CUHAS-Bugando) and other para-\nmedics and has a bed capacity of 1000. Bugando Medical\nCentre is one of the four largest referral hospitals in the\ncountry and serves as a referral centre for tertiary spe-\ncialist care for a catchment population of approximately\n13 million people from Mwanza, Mara, Kagera, Shinyanga,\nTabora and Kigoma regions.\nStudy subjects and procedures\nThe study included all patients with clinical diagnosis of\nallergic rhinitis presented with two or more recurrent\nnasal symptoms of excessive sneezing, watery nasal dis-\ncharge, nasal congestion and itching of nose and eyes in\nall age group and sex attended Bugando Medical Centre\nENT clinic and ENT wards during the study period.\nPatients with co-morbid conditions associated with aller-\ngic rhinitis like otitis media, nasal polyps, tonsillitis,\nhypertrophied turbinate and sinusitis were also included\nin the study. Patient who refused investigations i.e. nasal\nscrapings and those received intranasal steroid one week\nprior to the enrollment into the study were excluded\nfrom the study. Recruitment of patient to participate in\nthe study was done at ENT clinics and wards. Patients\nwere screened for inclusion criteria and those who met\nthe inclusion criteria were given an explanation about\nthe study and requested to sign a written informed con-\nsent for the study before being enrolled in the study. In\ncase of children below 18 years the Guardian/Parents\nwere asked to consent on their behalf. Convenient\nsampling of patients who met the inclusion criteria was\nperformed until the sample size was reached.\nData were collected using a pre-tested coded question-\nnaire and physical examination. Data administered in the\nquestionnaire included; patients characteristics (e.g. age,\nsex, occupation), nasal symptoms, eye symptoms, age\nof onset of symptoms, triggering factors, presence or\nabsence of family history of allergic rhinitis and asthma\nin the first and second degree relatives, presence of co\nmorbidity and the effects to the quality of life (defined as\ninterference with daily activities and sleep disturbances).\nAppropriate examination was done to all patients where\ncandidate with nose complaints were examined using\nanterior rhinoscopy. All candidates with ear complaints\nwere inspected using otoscope for evidence of eustachian\ntube dysfunction and otitis media. Children who showed\nfeatures of allergic rhinitis and history of sleep noisy\nsnoring or apnoea their posterior oropharyngeal wall\nwere examined for adenoid hypertrophy with the aid of\nwooden tongue spatula. Sinusitis in atopic patient was\ndefined by clinical presentation of facial pain, blocked\nnose, thicker and purulent rhinorrhoea and or anosmia.\nParanasal sinus radiographs X - Ray submental vertical\n(water) view was taken in all suspected respondents for\nair/fluid level, septal deviation and thickening mucosa\nand was interpreted by an experienced radiologist. Extra-\ncapsular tonsillectomy and adenoidectomies were done\nin selected patients who had enlarged tonsils and adenoid\nhypertrophy which obstruct breathing, causing snoring,\nand sleep apnoea, difficult in feeding and recurrent\nbacterial infection.\nIn selected patients with hypertrophy of inferior\nturbinate with obstructive nasal symptoms electrical\nSaid et al. BMC Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders 2012, 12:13 Page 2 of 9\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6815/12/13cauterization of submucosa of inferior turbinate under\ngeneral anaesthesia was done. Patient with chronic max-\nillary sinusitis were treated by Caldwell-luc procedure.\nThe research assistant and Principle Investigator\ngathered relevant information regarding history and\nphysical examination and the Scrapings of secretions\nand nasal mucosa cells [17] were taken from all patients\nand eosinophils, neutrophils and basophils count was\ndone. Nasal Eosinophil infiltration is the cornerstone of\nallergic inflammation [18] and was found to be sensitive\nfor the diagnosis of allergic rhinitis [19,20]. Nasal mucosal\nspecimens were scraped from the surfaces of the middle\nthirds of inferior turbinate with specially made wooden\nspatula as rhinoprobes. They transferred onto plain glass\nslides, fixed in 95% ethyl alcohol for at least 1 minute,\nexcess alcohol was drained. The collected slides were\nsent to the laboratory for staining. The slides were\ndipped sequentially in modified Wright- Giemsa stain,\nfor 15 seconds, in Volu-Sol buffer for 30 seconds, and\nin Volu-Sol hematology rinse for 5 seconds. The slides\nwere drained of excess fluid between the procedures.\nAfter air drying, the slides were examined under oil\nimmersion by light microscopy [21,22]. At least 10-well\nspread, high power epithelium fields were examined. It\nwas known from literature that nasal cytology assist in\n(1) distinguishing inflammatory from non-inflammatory\nrhinopathies; (2) distinguishing between allergic, non-\nallergic, and infectious rhinitis; (3) distinguishing be-\ntween viral and bacterial infections; (4) following the\ncourse of a disease; and (5) following the response to\ntreatment.\nThe quantitative score of nasal eosinophils and meta-\nchromatic cells were rated according to a scale previously\ndescribed by Meltzer [23]. The grading were semiquanti-\ntative on a scale of 0 to 4 +[21]. It was shown that the\npresence of either nasal eosinophilic or basophilic meta-\nchromatic cell provides the best sensitivity and specificity\n[20,24]. Eosinophil scores and/or basophilic metachrom-\natic cell scores of 1 was considered positive cut-off points\nfor the diagnosis of allergic rhinitis. The diagnosis of pa-\ntient with allergic rhinitis and associated co-morbidities\nwas made clinically based on the validated questionnaire\nderived from international studies of allergic rhinitis i.e.\nScore For Allergic Rhinitis (SFAR) and International\nStudy of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC)\nquestionnaire where they had satisfactory sensitivity and\nspecificity, in the absence of any allergic test in develop-\ning countries [3]\nAll patients with no co morbidities were treated con-\nservatively with intra nasal corticosteroids (Fluticasone)\nand oral antihistamine citerizine and selected patients\nwith co morbidities were operated accordingly. Patients\nwere followed up until the day of discharge or death.\nAfter discharge patients were followed up at our ENT\nclinic for one month (30 days) period. Length of hospital\nstay (LOS) and mortality were recorded at the end of\nstudy period.\nStatistical data analysis\nData was analyzed using SPSS software version 17.0 with\nthe guide of medical statistician. Data was summarized\nin the form of proportions frequency tables, bar and pie\ncharts for categorical variables. Appropriate summary\nwas used for continuous variables such as Mean, median,\nmode, standard deviation and histogram. Chi- square test\nwas used to test for significance of association between\npredictors and outcome variables in the categorical\nvariable. Odds ratio was calculated to test the strength\nof association between predictor and outcome variables\nin the continuous variables. Significance was defined as a\np-value of less than 0.05. Multivariate logistic regression\nanalysis was used to determine the predictor variables\nthat are associated with outcome.\nEthical consideration\nEthical approval to conduct the study was obtained from\nthe CUHAS-Bugando/BMC joint institutional ethic re-\nview committee before the commencement of the study.\nInformed consent was sought from each patient before\nbeing enrolled into the study.\nResults\nDuring the study period, a total of 1294 ENT patients\nwere seen at Bugando Medical Centre. Of these,\n200 patients had a clinical diagnosis of Allergic rhinitis.\nTen patients were excluded from the study due to failure\nto meet inclusion criteria. Thus, 190 patients were stud-\nied representing 14.7% of cases. There were 95 (50.0%)\nmales and 95 (50.0%) females with a male to female ratio\nof 1:1. The age of the patients raged from 5 months to\n56 years with a median age of 8.5 years. The model age\ngroup was 0 –10 years accounting 55.8% of cases\n(Table 1).\nTable 1 Distribution of patients according to age group\nAge group (Years) Frequency Percentage\n0 – 10 108 56.8\n11 – 20 23 12.1\n21 – 30 27 14.2\n31 -40 15 7.9\n41 – 50 11 5.8\n51- 60 5 2.6\n61+ 1 0.5\nTotal 190 100.0\nSaid et al.

(χ\n2=9.513, P=0.002). Ninety-eight (51.6%) patients\nhad eye symptoms (rhinoconjuctivitis), of which watery\neye discharge was the most common symptoms affecting\n33.2% of cases.\nMost patients 112 (58.9%) were able to identify the\ntriggers of their allergic symptom and dust was reported\nto be the most common triggering factor in 39.5% of\npatients (Table 3). There was a significant association\nbetween the dust allergens and sneezing in patient with\nallergic rhinitis (χ\n2 =12.391, P =0.002), there was also\nsignificant association between sex and strong perfume\nodors (χ\n2=4.583, P=0.032). Seventy-four (38.9%) patients\nreported to have family history of allergic rhinitis.\nIn this study, associated sleep disturbance was\nreported in 141 (74.2%) patients. There was a strong\nstatistical association between sleep disturbance and\npresence of adenoid hypertrophy (χ\n2=28.691, P =0.000)\nbut not with chronic tonsillitis (χ\n2=2.914, P =0.088).\nOne hundred and seventy-seven (93.3%) patients ad-\nmitted to have interference with their daily activities.\nMajority of patients 179 (92.6%) had co-morbidities\nassociated with allergic rhinitis as shown in Table 4.\nPatients who had allergic rhinitis with co-morbidities\nhad significant interference with quality of life (sleep dis-\nturbance and work) compared to allergic rhinitis\npatients without co-morbidities (χ\n2 =20.711, P =0.000),\nand younger age at onset had significant association with\ndevelopment of co-morbidities (χ\n2= 76.040, P =0.01).\nX-ray was taken in 14 patients who had symptoms of\nsinusitis. Out of these 5 (35.7%) were found to have\nradiological features of chronic sinusitis. Nasal scrapings\nwere taken in all 190 patients. Neutrophils were found\nin 177 (77.4%), esinophils 139 (73.2%) and there were\nno cells found in 18 (9.47%) slides. Eosinophils were\nhigher in females (χ\n2= 7.746, P =0.005) and in patient\nwith family history of AR (χ\n2 =5.309, P =0.021).\nOne hundred and four (54.7%) patients were admitted\nto hospital for surgical intervention resulting from co\nmorbidities associated with allergic rhinitis (Table 5).\nOf these, tonsillectomy was the most frequent type of\nsurgical procedure performed accounting for 68.3% of\ncases. The remaining 86 (45.3%) patients were treated by\nnon-surgical approach (conservatively).\nThe overall hospital stay for the admitted patients\nranged from 2 to 28 days with a mean of 4.6± 3.6 days.\nThe median was 3 days.\nTable 2 Distribution of patients according to education\nand occupation\nVariable Response Frequency Percentage\nLevel of education Pre school 77 40.5\nPrimary education 44 23.3\nSecondary education 51 26.8\nTertiary education 18 9.5\nTotal 190 100\nOccupation Students 68 60.1\nPeasants 18 15.9\nBusiness 13 11.5\nTeachers 8 7.1\nMining workers 2 1.8\nIndustrial workers 2 1.8\nHealth workers 2 1.8\nTotal 113 100.0\nTable 3 Distribution of patients according to nasal and\neye symptoms\nSymptoms Response Frequency Percentage\nNasal symptoms Blocked nose 144 75.8\nRunny nose 124 65.3\nRecurrent\nsneezing\n111 58.4\nNasal itching 101 53.2\nEye symptoms Watery eyes 63 33.2\nEye itching 62 32.6\nTriggers of the\nsymptoms\nDust 75 39.5\nCold weather 53 27.9\nPerfume 34 17.9\nSmoke 7 3.7\nTable 4 Distribution of patients according to their co\nmorbidities\nCo morbidities Number of patients Percentage\nRecurrent tonsillitis 105 55.3\nAdenoid hypertrophy 88 46.3\nInferior turbinate hypertrophy 77 40.5\nNasal polyps 18 9.5\nEar discharge 16 8.4\nSinusitis 10 5.3\nSaid et al.

Of these 5 (55.5%) patients were due to long hos-\npital stay before operation. Two (22%) patients were due\nto financial constrains, and 2 (22%) patient were due to\nunknown reason.\nIn this study 3 patients died giving mortality rate of\n1.6%. All deaths were attributed to post operative and\nanesthetic complications. Two (1.9%) patients died from\nrespiratory arrest post operative and one (0.9%) patient\ndied of cardiopulmonary arrest during recovery period.\nDiscussion\nAllergic rhinitis represents a global healthy problem with\nconsiderable prevalence especially in children [25]. The\nmajority of patients in this study were children which\nis comparable with previous studies done else where\n[26-29]. The reason for increased number of children\nwith allergic rhinitis to attend medical services in this\nstudy may be due to the fact that allergic rhinits is asso-\nciated with severe and troublesome symptoms which are\nexacerbated by recurrent viral infections making parents\nto seek medical attention while majority of symptoms\nof allergic rhinitis are ignored by adult patients.\nIn this study, no gender predilection was observed\nwhich is in agreement with other studies [30]\n, but at vari-\nant with other studies which reported female [29,31,32]\nand male [33] predominance respectively.\nThe prevalence of allergic rhinitis is increasing in\ndeveloping countries [34] due to the introduction of\nWestern life style [35] and environmental factors [25]\nand it differs among countries and even among regions\nwithin the same country [20]. In industrial countries like\nUSA the allergic rhinitis is one among the well docu-\nmented disease and high prevalence of allergic rhinitis\nhave been reported to be more than 40% [36]. In the\npresent study the point prevalence of allergic rhinitis at\nBugando Medical Centre was 14.7%. This prevalence is\ncomparable to 13.7%,13% found in Kinshasa [37] Nairobi\nKenya [30] respectively. Higher prevalence of allergic\nrhinitis have been reported in African countries such as\n29.6% in Nigeria [29] and more than 30% in Cape Town\nSouth Africa [11]. Several theories for the increasing\nprevalence of allergic rhinitis are climatic factors, in-\ncreasing in winter and rainy seasons, dietary changes,\nenvironmental factors including industrial pollution.\nThese factors may also influence the prevalence in our\nstudy and therefore it is recommended that future stud-\nies should be done in different periods within a year to\ndetermine the variations. The prevalence of allergic\nrhinitis in our study may actually be underestimate as\nmajority of patients with this condition are treated in\nthe peripheral hospitals and only patients with severe\nsymptoms or associated co-morbidities present to ENT\nsurgeon. A better picture of the magnitude of Allergic\nrhinitis in this region requires comprehensive data col-\nlection including both hospital and population-based\nstudy.\nClinically allergic rhinitis is defined as allergen induced\ninflammation of the nasal membrane and surrounding\ntissues that results in sneezing, rhinorrhoea, conjunctivitis,\nnasal congestion, and pruritis of the nose, palate, throat\nand ears [38]. Nasal obstruction is associated with sleep\ndisorders, which can have a profound effect on quality of\nlife, mental health, learning, behavior and attention [39].\nVast majority of respondents in this study had nasal\nsymptoms of which blocked nose was found in many\npatients and it was found to be the most troublesome\nsymptom. The same observation was also reported in\nother studies done else where [40,41]. The reason for the\nnasal obstruction was due to the co-existence with\nadenoid hypertrophy, nasal congestion, inferior turbinate\nhypertrophy and nasal polyps in majority of our study\npopulation. In this study blocked nose showed significant\nassociation with adenoid hypertrophy in children.\nIn the present study, the high proportion of patients\nhad runny nose (rhinorrhoea) compared to other studies\nfound in literature [42]. The reason for increased pro-\nportion of runny nose is the fact that runny nose is com-\nmon in small children which is commonly associated\nwith viral and bacteria infection especially in under five\nwhich were the majority in our study.\nThe rate of allergic conjunctivitis found in this study is\nhigher as compared to other studies [26,43] and major-\nities of patients had watery eye discharge as compared to\neye itching. Ocular symptoms were considered trivial ill-\nness by most of our patients and were not complained.\nThe reason for the high proportion of allergic conjunc-\ntivitis could be due to dusty environment which causes\nsymptoms in majorities of our study population. The\nhigh prevalence of rhinoconjunctivitis was also found in\nmajorities of the centers of Africa and raises number of\nquestions and non allergic factors are found to be re-\nsponsible [44]. Further studies are needed to determine\nthe factors responsible for rhinoconjunctivitis.\nIn the present study it was shown that the allergic\nrhinitis symptoms could begins as early as one month\nTable 5 Distribution of patients according to the type of\nsurgical procedure performed (N= 104)\nType of procedure Number of patients Percentage\nTonsillectomy 71 68.3\nAdenoidectomy 55 52.9\nPolypectomy 7 6.7\nCaldwell luc 3 2.9\nTurbinectomy 3 2.9\nSaid et al.

This could be due to differences\nin environment between the two countries. The study\nalso shows that the early onset of symptoms of allergic\nrhinitis is significantly associated with the development\nof co-morbidities. This explains the needs for public\nawareness and early medical intervention.\nVarious environmental factors were found to increase\nthe risk of allergic rhinitis especially in children. Pollu-\ntion factors such as environmental tobacco smoke ex-\nposure, moulds, road traffic pollution and dusts seem to\nbe important risk factors of allergic rhinitis [25]. In this\nstudy exposure to dust, weather changes, strong perfume\norder, and smoke were most common self reported trig-\ngers for allergic rhinitis where dust reported by major-\nities of patients. This observation is in agreement with\nother studies reported elsewhere [2,46].\nThe proportion of patients with self-reported allergy\nto dust was 39.5% which is lower than reported in\nNigeria [29] and South Africa [11]. Seventy three percent\nof respondents noted trouble symptoms inside their\nhouses. The reason for these findings could be due to the\nplenty of dust in our immediate environment and house\ndust which mainly consists of dust mite, moulds, insects\nand animal dander may be the etiological trigger in the\nstudy population. In this study dust was found to have\nstatistical significant association with sneezing. Sneezing\naims to expel mucus containing irritating allergens and\ncleanse the nasal cavity.\nIt was found in the present study that 17.9% and\n27.9% of patients were affected by strong perfume and\ncold weather respectively. This rate is lower compared\nto 31.1% and 32.4% respectively reported in the litera-\nture [47]. Female patients with allergic rhinitis showed\nstatistical significant association with strong perfume\nodor. This might be due to the social habits of using\nstrong perfumes which is commonly in female compared\nto males.\nMany patients with allergic rhinitis had their first\ndegree relatives suffering from the disease. Similar find-\nings were reported in other studies [11,48,49]. Unlike in\nother studies where family history was significant risk\nfactor for allergic rhinitis [11,45], in the current study\nfamily history of allergic rhinitis did not reach statistical\nsignificance. The reason for poor association could be\ndue to small sample as compared to the general popula-\ntion. However family history of allergic rhinitis showed\nstatistical significant association with early onset nasal\nsymptoms, which leads to early development of co-\nmorbidities.\nThe quality of life is often impaired in patients with al-\nlergic rhinitis, due to the classic symptoms of the disease\n(sneezing, pruritis, rhinorrhoea and nasal obstruction).\nIn addition, the pathophysiology of allergic rhinitis often\ndisrupt sleep, leading to fatigue, daytime sleepiness,\nirritability and memory deficit [39]. Sleep disturbance\nwas reported in most of our study population. Similar\nobservation was also reported from other studies [50].\nWhile 74.2% of our patient had their sleep affected,\nMachimu at al [51] reported sleep disturbance in 76.6%\nof the study population. Nasal obstruction and nasal\ncongestion were responsible for the sleep disturbances.\nIn this study nasal obstruction and congestion cause\nday time sleepiness in more than 70% of respondents\nespecially those who had sleep disturbance during night\ntime. This is in agreement with previous study [52]. The\nreason for the nasal obstruction was adenoid hyper-\ntrophy in one hand and hypertrophy of inferior turbinate\nin another hand. Adenoid hypertrophy was complained\nin majority of patients and it was significantly associated\nwith sleep disturbance in children. Another cause of\nnasal obstruction was rhinorrhoea triggered by allergens.\nMost of our patients 93.3% reported to have interfer-\nence with their daily activities such as playing, working\netc. and thus they have impaired social life. This is in\nagreement with other studies found in literature [53,54]\nand it is higher than that reported by Bousquet [55].\nThe reason for the interference with daily activities is\nprobably due to severe symptoms of nasal blockage and\nrhinorrhoea which also causes embarrassment to patients.\nBesides its direct effect on the quality of life, allergic\nrhinitis has significant co-morbid disorders such as\nasthma, sinusitis, otitis media, conjunctivitis and adenoid\nhypertrophy [25]. In the present study, more than 90%\nof patients had associated co-morbidities which is con-\ntrary with other studies [34]. Many other studies reported\nlow incidence of associated co-morbidities. We could not\nfind the reason for these differences, this call for further\nstudies to explain these differences.\nMultidisciplinary approach is needed in the treatment\nof allergic rhinitis and its co-morbidities involving\npaediatricians, allergists and the otolaryngologists [25].\nAllergen avoidance require aggressive environmental\ncontrol which is effective but often practically difficult\n[56]. Intranasal steroids are the treatment of choice and\nare more effective than antihistamines for relief of nasal\nobstruction however surgical therapy is reserved for co-\nmorbidities refractory to medical treatment. Immuno-\ntherapy may also be used [57].\nWith regard to treatment patterns, majority of patients\n(54.7%) in this study underwent surgical treatment\nwhich is at variant with findings from other studies [11]\nwhere majority of allergic rhinitis patient were treated\nconservatively and surgical management was reserved for\nminority of cases who were refractory to medical treat-\nment. The most common indications for surgical treat-\nment in the present study were adenoid hypertrophy,\nrecurrent tonsillitis, nasal obstruction due to hypertrophy\nSaid et al. BMC Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders 2012, 12:13 Page 6 of 9\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6815/12/13of inferior turbinate, nasal polyps and sinusitis. The high\nrate of surgical treatment found in this study is attributed\nto high proportion of patients with associated co-\nmorbidities requiring surgical interventions\nIn agreement with previous report [58], conservative\ntreatment in this study was done using mono therapy\nwith steroid nasal spray fluticasone which does not re-\nsult in complete relief of symptoms and so prolongs the\nhospital visit and affect compliance with long term use.\nAllergen exposure in atopic individual activates mast\ncells resulting in the release of mediators and cytokines\ncapable of inducing inflammatory cell recruitment in-\ncluding eosinophils, neutrophils and basophils at the tar-\nget organ level. Eosinophils in the nasal smear has shown\nto display the best correlation with clinical allergic\nrhinitis [59], and can be used not only to establishes the\ndiagnosis of allergic rhinitis but also useful in the follow\nup of patients with this condition [22]. In this study oesi-\nnophils were found in 73.2% of patients and were signifi-\ncantly associated with female sex and family history of\nallergic rhinitis. The reason for this association was not\nknown\nPolymorpho-nuclear cells were found in 77.4% of our\npatients. Since the presence of neutrophils provides evi-\ndence substantiating the diagnosis of nasal infections,\nhigh rate of nasal neutrophils in this study indicate that\nnasal infections is common in these groups.\nNasal smears for oesinophils, basophils and neutro-\nphils were negative in 9.7% of the slides. Unlike observa-\ntion from other studies that nasal mucosa scrapings in\nallergic rhinitis patients had large numbers of basophilic\nmetachromatic cells [60] in this studies no basophils was\nfound. The reason could be due to the fact that basophil\ncells are found predominately in the nasal mucosa [23],\nwhere proper nasal curettes (rhino-probe) are required\nfor acquisition of a large number of intact cells to inter-\npret. In contrary neutrophils and oesinophils are present\nin both nasal secretion and within the nasal mucosa.\nThe overall average length of hospital stay for in\npatients was 4.6 days. However for the patient under-\nwent adenotonsillectomy the average hospital stay was\n3 days. This was in contrary with other studies done in\nMalaysia where adenotonsillectomy was done safely as\nday care surgery [46].\nWhile gender was not found to be a risk factor,\nyounger age group was significantly associated with\nincreased length of hospital stay post adenotonsillect-\nomy. Same observation was also reported in the literature\n[61]. This is contrary with other studies [62]. The reason\nfor increased length of hospital stay was mostly due to\ndelay in conduction of the procedure, where patients\nstayed in the ward for days awaiting surgery.\nPatients who had chronic sinusitis were found to have\nstatistical significant association with increased length of\nhospital stay. The reason for this is that during post\noperative period, most of patients had associated oedema\nand prolonged catheter placed for sinus drainage.\nIn the present study post operative bleeding was the\nmost post surgical complication. This is consistent with\nother study [63]. The rate of post operative bleeding of\n2.88% in the present study was in agreement to the rate\nof 2.4% found in other studies [64]. The low rate of post\ntonsillectomy bleeding was attributed to the suture tie\ntechniques used to arrest bleeding during tonsillectomy\nat Bugando Medical Centre and also weekly follow up\npost surgery was found to be effective in early detection\nof delayed and episodic bleeding which can be corrected\nbefore the development of life-threatening anaemia.\nMajority of patients were discharged against medical\nadvice in the current study was caused by long hospital\nstay especially before surgery. This is attributed to inad-\nequate operating days for ENT patients despite of high\nnumber of patients demanding surgical services. Further\nmore lack of essential surgical equipments such as\noxygen, gauze and surgical gowns during the study\nperiod led to delay of surgical procedures.\nAR is not common to cause death but it may occur\nfrom its co-morbid conditions as 1.5% mortality rate\nreported in a study done in Sweden [65] or as a result of\nsurgical complications. In the current study death rate\npost adenotonsillectomy was 1.6%. High mortality rate\nwas previously reported [66] although there was no post-\noperative deaths reported in study done in Germany [67].\nIn our study death occurred within the first 24 hours\npost adenotonsillectomy in younger children who had\nsevere obstructive symptoms. Aspiration and respiratory\narrest may probably be the cause of death. This calls for\nimprovement of pediatric post operative care.\nThere was no death caused by bleeding in this study.\nThe reason was careful inspection of the nasopharynx\nbefore performing surgery and curettage in a piecemeal\nfashion under visual control which was done during\neach adenoidectomy in order to prevent direct injury to\naberrant arteries.\nThe potential limitations of this study include the\nabsence of allergy testing, short study period, presence of\nneutrophils in the nose and failure of estimating the\nmeasure of quality of life based on a standardized and\nvalidated (generic or disease-related) questionnaires. How-\never, despite these limitations, the study has provided local\ndata that can help health care workers develop guideline\nfor early detection and proper treatment of allergic\nrhinitis and so reduce development of co-morbidities.\nConclusion\nAllergic rhinitis is common condition which is under\ndiagnosed in patients attending otorhinolaryngology de-\npartment at Bugando Medical Centre and accounts for\nSaid et al. BMC Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders 2012, 12:13 Page 7 of 9\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6815/12/1314.7% of all otorhinolaryngology admissions. Allergic\nrhinitis causes considerable morbidities especially in\nchildren. Many of the allergic rhinitis triggers are com-\nmonly found in our environment and houses. It is there-\nfore recommended that:\n\u0001 High index of suspicion and improvement of\nlaboratory diagnostic facilities for allergic rhinits are\nneeded in order elevate the prevalence of this\ndisease.\n\u0001 Early detection and treatment of allergic rhinitis in\nchildren is needed to improve healthy of the\nsufferers\n\u0001 Avoidance of allergic rhinitis trigger is the best first\nline of management of allergic rhinits and so all\npatients should be given education on avoidance of\nthe triggering factors.\n\u0001 Further study on incidence and risk factors of\nallergic rhinitis at Bugando Medical Centre ENT\npatients is highly recommended.\nCompeting interests\nThe author declares that they have no competing interest.\nAuthors’ contributions\nSAS designed the study, contributed in literature search, data collection and\nmanagement of patients.
