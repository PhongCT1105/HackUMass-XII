Increasing numbers of devel­opmental psychologists are conducting research on edu­cation-related topics (see Bruer’s discussion of research in cognitive psychology, 1993; and the edited volume by McGilly, 1994). Others see the implications of their theory and research for practice and are involved at some level in instituting inservices or developing resources for teachers and caretakers (cf. developing community and teacher partnerships: Comer, Haynes, Joyner, & Ben-Avie, 1996; Damon, 1997; Nicolopoulou & Cole, 1993; developing soft­ware for anchored instruction; Cognition and Technology Group at Vanderbilt, 1996; establishing school-university' Note that in accord with the scope of this volume, even though topics in developmental psychology and instruction are relevant to the life span of the individual, the present chapter focuses pri­marily on instruction of children and adolescents. Furthermore, this chapter focuses specifically on neurologically intact stu­dents, although the general approach to students’ needs that is described has relevance to instruction for atypical populations.Questioning 237 Grouping 243ISSUES FROM AND FOR PRACTICE 251The Language of Instruction 251Developmentai Psychology and Practice 253Coordinating Research and Practice 258APPENDIX: A SECOND CASE IN TWO FORMATS 259Lecture Format 259Interactive Format 260ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 260REFERENCES 260collaborations: Baird & Northfield, 1992; facilitating teacher networks; Webb & Romberg, 1994; providing an In­ternet forum for teacher resources: Renninger, Weimar, & Klotz, 1997; providing training and support for Cognitively Guided Instruction: Fennema, Carpenter, & Peterson, 1989). Yet others have embedded the study of student learn­ing in the ongoing process of classroom practice (cf. Brown & Campione, 1994; Cobb, Yackel, & Wood, 1995).There are differences in emphasis, however, between re­searchers trained in developmental psychology and those trained in education, stemming from their differing pur­poses and goals and reflected in the nature of the issues with which the two groups are concerned. For example, de­velopmental psychologists typically study issues related to how and why children learn, whereas educators are more likely to focus their attention on what and how to teach. Developmental psychologists study learning across a wide variety of contexts largely unrelated to school, whereas ed­ucators focus on student learning in school. Developmental psychologists may study an atypicality such as Down Syn­drome in order to learn more about typical development; educators primarily read about the populations and subject matter content within which they themselves work. Finally,211212 Developmental Psychology and Instruction: Issues From and For Practicealthough both developmental psychologists and educators study children or adolescents as discrete groups, develop­mental psychologists refer to their subjects as children or adolescents, while educators call them students and often associate them with grade-level, school-based accomplish­ments (“second graders do .. .Thus, education-related studies in developmental psy­chology are often more distal than proximal for educators, meaning that the connections between the research ques­tion being addressed and classroom practice are not obvi­ous. Even in cases where researchers specify implications for practice, these often take the form of suggesting that practitioners promote metacognition, for example, rather than specifying how one might actually implement this suggestion in the classrooin.There is almost no developmental research that specifi­cally addresses questions related to classroom practice such as: Is it always bad to give students a task they cannot complete? What do I do with the four kids who just can’t keep up with the work? Why don’t students learn better when I’ve given them something interesting to read? How do I get my students to really discuss something? Should students keep the same partners for all of their lab periods? Why aren’t my students learning anything when they do small group work? For such questions—the questions of practitioners—the applicability of research findings typi­cally need to be inferred and conclusions treated as work­ing hypotheses.Recently, researchers in cognitive science, in particular, have been seeking to understand the selection of content for curriculum, including both selection of content that will provide the student with a critical base for subsequent knowledge development, and its sequencing (see Greeno, Collins, & Resnick, 1996 for a review). There also is a need, however, to begin seriously considering what we know about instructional practice; the organization and process of teaching a class of students, an inservice for teachers, and so on (Shulman, 1986).^It would be even more accurate to describe the continuum of overlap and variation between those trained in developmental psychology or educational psychology and those trained in prac­tice. There are those who have taught and worked with children, those who in their studies have come to be familiar with children of a particular age or grade level, those whose training has con­sistently involved them in grounding their understanding of the­ory and research methods in practice, and so on. Differences in background contribute to differences in the lens and language available for describing learning. Here, two endpoints are de­scribed by way of establishing the band within which discussions of student learning take place.The content of instruction is the specific topic of other chapters in this Handbook. Here, the emphasis is on con­sidering what students need by way of instruction; the knowledge we have about instruction at present; and the re­sources to which we might turn in order to consider more fully the application or implications of developmental psy­chology in everyday practice. What might we still need to know, for example, before concluding that lecturing or di­rect instruction is necessarily bad and small group work needs to occur in all classrooms? While it is a given that in­struction never occurs independent of content or subject matter, specific consideration of instruction enables exam­ination of what is and is not understood about the processes through which learning is facilitated. Information about how and why students learn has implications for how stu­dents might most effectively be taught.The chapter has its roots in James’ (1899) and Gage’s (1978) discussions of learning and the art of teaching, or what has been labeled the problem of theory and practice. It also builds on that of Brown, Bransford, Ferrara, and Campione (1983) in the preceding Handbook of Child Psy­chology (Mussen, 1983). In particular, their description of learning as complex, interactive, and dynamic provides a foundation for the present discussion.Three working assumptions guide the organization of this chapter:1. Effective instructional decisions are informed by an ar­ticulated and coherent sense of how students learn and develop over time.2. If more educators (teachers, teacher-educators, adminis­trators, policymakers, parents, etc.) were knowledgeable about developmental theory and research, and had tools to think about classroom decision making that were in­formed by what is known about how students learn, re­search in developmental psychology would radically change the mainstream of educational practice.3. If more researchers were knowledgeable about educa­tional practice—the strengths and needs of teachers and their working knowledge about students—and invested time working with educators to consider the implica­tions and directions of their research efforts, research could contribute more directly to educational practice.This chapter consists of three main sections. The first section overviews the relevance of topics in developmental psychology for instruction. To provide a common set of in­structional formats to which the reader can refer through­out the chapter, it opens with two formats for teaching about what makes the Jurassic Period the Jurassic Period; aDevelopmental Psychology and Instruction 213lecture format and an interactive format. These are fol­lowed by a synthesis of the developmental literature on re­search and practice that permits consideration of links between instructional formats and conceptions of learning, students’ needs, what we know about development, and its implications for the process of instruction.The second portion of the chapter consists of an overview of issues raised in recent research and reports on large grou{> instruction (lecture and discussion methods), questioning, and classroom grouping. This section is in­tended to permit consideration of the information or lan­guage currently available to educators for thinking about instruction. Following each topic, commentary addresses the way in which the literature reviewed contributes to our thinking about the Jurassic Period case formats and our un­derstanding of students’ abilities to access, process or work through, and complete a task. Following this, unanswered questions are identified, particularly those that stem from and might be addressed by research and theory in develop­mental psychology.The third section of the chapter further considers the language of instruction as it is reflected in the overview of the literature. It also addresses the tensions between re­search and practice in general, and developmental psychol­ogy and practice more specifically as these are highlighted in this literature. Finally, discussion focuses on current efforts and possibilities for coordinating research and practice.DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY AND INSTRUCTIONThis chapter focuses on the application of developmental psychology to instructional practice, although what might be technically classified as literature from child psychol­ogy, cognitive science, developmental education, and edu­cational psychology also form a basis for the discussion.^ In^For purposes of clarity, some definitions of terms related to the topic of developmental psychology and instruction are listed below:1. Developmental psychology describes the study of distinct and shared sequences that characterize human growth.2. Applied developmental psychology refers to the study of de­velopmental psychology in clinical, educational, and policy settings.3. Cognitive science is the study of how the mind works.4. Child psychology is the study of the child’s cognitive, so­cial, and affective functioning.keeping with the mission of this volume, the specific em­phasis of this chapter is the application of developmental psychology to instructional practice.“Development,” or change in how and what students learn, is not simply a matter of identifying differences among students as a function of age or grade level. It refers to transitions or qualitative (stage-related) shifts in stu­dents’ cognitive, social, and affective functioning (the way in which they problem solve on the playground, in mathe­matics class, and as they work on choosing words to write a story) and involves an emergent relation between the bio­logical being and psychological self and the physical and social environment. The individual is at the same time both a contributor to and a product of a larger system that in­cludes family, school, and culture (Bronfenbrenner, 1979).Developmental psychology as it applies to schools ap­pears to have more to do with transitions than qualitative changes, however, since teachers work with students who typically vary in age by no more than two years. The se­quences that characterize these transitions and the differ­ences in their organization (Rogoff, 1996) and structure (Kuhn, 1995) can be useful information for teachers. By way of example, an adaptation of Piaget’s (1950; see also Sigel, 1986) observations to student learning would suggest that early in students’ encounters with a class of objects or events—a subject area or set of concepts to be learned—a characteristic of their thinking is that it is dominated by the connections that can be made to the concepts to be learned. Students more easily make connections to tasks that involve them in making logical extensions based on what they al­ready know, recognizing relations, and working with con­cepts (applying them to other instances, analyzing their parts, etc.). With experience, students are increasingly able to move between working with concrete and abstract in­stances, and to understand concepts as they are represented in symbols or abstraction. Just because students can work with symbols or abstraction, this does not obviate their need for opportunities to manipulate or directly experiment with concepts. Students can look as if they understand something when they are still working to understand it, and they can5. A developmental approach to education refers to teaching that is responsive to the cognitive and social strengths of the child, and as such involves him or her in optimally challenging tasks.6. Developmental education is a term used by educators to re­fer to a developmental approach to education; however, in practice it is often misconstrued to be relevant only to the education of slow or atypical learners.7. Educational psychology is the application of principles of psychology to educational issues.214 Developmental Psychology and Instruction: Issues From and For Practiceappear to understand material when they are being assisted that they in fact “mostly understand.”As students work with tasks, they are in a position to ask questions (generate hypotheses) that will enable them to further clarify and question what they know. The transi­tions that occur prior to students’ abilities to generate de­veloped and testable hypotheses highlight the benefits of using brainstorms and hypothesis-generation as teaching methods early on in work with students. Students (or the individual student) are always in a process of developing their understanding. There is always more to learn (other ways in which to think about the content, other questions to ask, and so on). Furthermore, learners at different ages are similar in their need to develop a foundation for under­standing that begins with their establishing a connection to a concept and learning the skills and information necessary to rerepresent it to themselves as being both abstract and concrete.It also may be important to underscore the point that acquisition of knowledge about social studies, mathemat­ics, and so forth, is tied to developing cognition. It is not entirely dependent on the structure of the subject matter. Rather, based on what students understand, content-based information can be sequenced and particular methods or formats of instruction employed in order to facilitate their abilities to make connections to it. Such adjustments to in­structional practice provide students with the base of skills and knowledge necessary for further developing their understanding. To rely on an external or “adult” model of knowledge to be learned (the structure of a disci­pline), however, is to ignore the comprehension of the stu­dent (Gelman & Brown, 1986; Sigel, 1986). This does not negate the usefulness of mapping students’ developing un­derstanding of a subject area or the usefulness of task analysis, but it suggests that instruction for students can­not be optimal if the particular strengths and needs of the students being taught are not taken into consideration.By definition, then, a developmental approach to in­struction involves the simultaneous consideration of the students’ characteristics as learners, the nature of the tasks to be learned, methods for adjusting these tasks so that learning can take place, criteria for evaluating what the student still needs to learn (Bransford, 1979; Brown, 1982; Brown et al., 1983; Cronbach & Snow, 1977), and the environment of the learner (Bronfenbren- ner, 1979). Furthermore, it involves attention to both the cognitive, social, and affective developmental status of the learner.Central to such decision making is information about how students learn: how the student perceives information.represents this information to him or herself, and acts upon it (Wozniak, 1985). This information forms the basis for describing implications for practice. At this time what might be called the “working knowledge” of developmental researchers, from a variety of theoretical orientations, in­cludes the following:1. Each student’s knowledge or understanding is individu­ally constructed in relation to the others (i.e., the teacher, other students) and objects (i.e., texts, com­puter software, classroom rituals, assigned tasks) in the environment;2. The process of apprehending or perceiving something (i.e., a concept) involves readiness in terms of atten- tional capacity, short-term memory, prior knowledge or experience, individual interest, and the particular affor- dances of (or actions suggested by) the task, including how situated within a particular context the learning is;3. What the individual attends to influences what he or she represents to him- or herself; and4. What individuals represent to themselves in turn affects the particular action or sets of actions in which they en­gage or are ready to engage.This working knowledge provides the basis for thinking about whether and why a student will learn what the teacher is teaching. It does not, however, specifically address actual transitions or change in students’ understanding. Informa­tion about student learning needs to be linked to real stu­dents and their strengths and needs as learners: instruction is a “live” or dynamic and reciprocal relation between a group of students and their teacher. It involves providing op­portunities for students to develop their problem-solving abilities and their skills and understanding of specific knowledge (cf. Anunon & Hutcheson, 1989; Baird & North- field, 1992; Copple, Sigel, & Saunders, 1984; Newman, Griffin, & Cole, 1989; Silver, 1986; Tharp & Gallimore, 1988; Yackel, 1995), as well as their value for themselves as learners based on their current understanding.Descriptions of effective (Bredekamp, 1993; National Council for the Social Studies, 1994; National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, 1989; see also Brown & Cam- pione’s, 1994, discussion of “first principles”) and poten­tially developmentally appropriate practices include:1. Creating opportunities for student questioning;2. Providing opportunities for students to practice and be­gin to own the language of the subject area or domain in which they are working;Developmental Psychology and Instruction 2153. Appreciating that there is not necessarily one right an­swer, but that there are different perspectives (dimen­sions to the problem to be solved, approximations) to the right answer;4. Emphasizing the process of problem solution;5. Drawing on students’ prior experience;6. Requiring that students reflect on material covered through journals, discussion, written summaries, and so forth;7. Specifying immediate goals so the student is clear about what is to be accomplished and why;8. Specifying each student’s role in a given task so that he or she knows both what is expected and for what he or she is responsible;9. Encouraging students’ repeated work with skills and discourse-knowledge in different types of contexts;10. Enabling students to exchange ideas with others in or­der to gain information or perspective on the work they are undertaking.It is difficult for many teachers to adjust instructional tasks to accommodate student strengths and needs and then sequence these tasks to enable students to meet the chal­lenges that were once difficult for them. There is no algo­rithm for what teachers should do. Instead, they need to learn to work with and help students to develop the cogni­tive strategies that support their abilities to perform the tasks they are assigned (Rosenshine, Meister, & Chapman, 1996).Take the case of a mathematics teacher who is using one of the newly revised texts that provides problems for stu­dents to pursue in small group work. The problems are challenging and require the students to apply what they have been learning in new ways. Neither the teacher nor the students, however, have had much experience with group work. The challenge problems are intended to take a full 40-minute period with all group members fully participat­ing—but short of a description of effective group work be­haviors, which the teacher reviewed with the students the first week in class, there is no additional thought on the part of the teacher that she or he needs to teach the students how to do group work. The teacher thinks this information has been covered. Thus, when the group work flounders be­cause some students are not focused and others still come to the teacher with questions, the group work is cut out of the curriculum.In an alternative scenario, the teacher recognizes that the students need to learn how to work together in groups, and knows that telling them about roles early in the term isno guarantee that they will carry this information through to their own work in small groups. Thus, the teacher might adjust and sequence instruction suggested by the text to meet the strengths and needs of the students. She or he could introduce the students to small group work by having them complete a portion of the work for the problem in the small group and then bring that information back to the larger group for discussion. Following this, the teacher might, over the course of several days, keep involving stu­dents in 5- to 10-minute periods of work with a partner that would provide a critical component of the learning for the day. The teacher might also encourage the students to work with a different person each day in order to enable them to practice working with other people. As the teacher moves to involving the students in longer blocks of paired and eventually small group work, she or he can build account­ability into the assignment by collecting the problem(s) on which the students have worked at the end of the period of small group work. Finally, following their work in the groups, the teacher can encourage the students to talk about the content of their learning—new insights, connections, and so on—and what has worked for them (and what has not) in the process of working with others. Such informa­tion would provide the basis for subsequent planning for that class.There are no guarantees that using small groups in class is sufficient for students to learn; benefits can accrue from carefully planned use of small groups in teaching, however. (See review of research on small groups by Lou et al., 1996.) In the case of the mathematics classroom described, the process of working together in small groups can give the students practice using the language of mathematics. It also can enable them to gain some perspective on what the possible approaches to problem solution might be. In fact, each member of the group is in a position to discover gaps in both his or her understanding and that of the others in the group (Webb, 1989). This acknowledges the appropri­ateness of not knowing and coming to know, as part of the process of learning. Furthermore, it provides a context that can lead students to search together for new information, enabling them to expand and solidify the understanding of all group members (Webb, 1989). Finally, the process of working together in groups and then reconvening as part of a larger group discussion of the problem can enable stu­dents to know the questions they need to ask or the work they need to take on in order to complete the task as as­signed (see discussions in Lindquist, 1989; Yackel, 1995).There is no algorithm that can provide information about what students will or will not understand. Teachers need to learn from watching and talking with their students216 Developmental Psychology and Instruction: Issues From and For Practiceabout what is still not clear to them (see related discussion in Wood, 1995). They can be assisted by documentation of the types of strategies students might employ in similar sit­uations. This kind of teacher resource is central to projects such as Cognitively Guided Instruction (Fennema et al., 1989) and teaching practice in Japan (Stigler, Fernandez, & Yoshida, 1996). Even when such resources are not available to teachers, however, once teachers are in situations that encourage them to talk with others about the way they work with cognitive strategies—the way they adjust their use of group work, embed strategies into the content of what they are teaching, and are enabled to respond to the develop­mental strengths and needs of their students—such adjust­ments in their teaching become a matter of course (Baird & Northfield, 1992; Black & Ammon, 1992; Comer et al., 1996; Wilson, Miller, & Yerkes, 1993).A significant byproduct of developmental approaches to instruction is that problems with management and teacher- student relationships are significantly reduced and even eliminated when students are able to perform the tasks they have been assigned (Comer, Haynes, & Joyner, 1996; Lindquist, 1989; Palincsar & Klenk, 1991). This makes sense; Students cannot connect to tasks or even figure out what the relevant strategies for a task are if it is so dis­crepant (so removed from their strengths and needs) that they do not have access to it.A Case in Two FormatsA case is presented here in two formats: a lecture format and an interactive format,'* in order to set forth a common set of instructional practices to which the reader can refer throughout the rest of the chapter. The two formats are de­signed specifically for a second grade class, but they could also be used with preschool, later elementary, middle school, high school, or even college students. Necessary adjustments would include changes in the content to be learned (information, skills, and concepts) and, depending on the students’ experience in interactive classrooms, the description of the interactive format (increasing or de­creasing its focus on problems, independent learning, using the resources of others to solve problems, etc.).''This case is derived from Stephen Weimar’s work with second grade students at The School in Rose Valley during the spring of 1996. A second case example is included in the Appendix. It rep­resents another example of a case in a lecture and an interactive format. Presenting two sets of cases enables the interested reader to consider more fully another example of a lecture and an interactive format and the necessary characteristics of each.For the purposes of this portion of the chapter, it is as­sumed that either the lecture or the interactive format could be considered developmentally appropriate practice. Whether this is the case, however, is dependent upon the particular students’ prior knowledge, metacognitive aware­ness, self-concept, as well as the culture of learning (D’Andrade, 1984, 1990) in which they are immersed.^The particular topic of this case—the Jurassic Period is intended to enable all readers to think about instructional formats and their role in development; the case easily could have been set in a math classroom or a reading class (see the Appendix for a second set of case formats on the topic of U.S. colonization). Both formats are designed to provide an interdisciplinary introduction to the Jurassic Period, in which students address concepts of period, time scale, evo­lution, decay and fossilization, ecology (the system of the period), and paleontology. Materials for the class include bones and fossils, time lines, the Internet Resource Center, a chart depicting the evolution of dinosaurs, a diagram of a dig, and so on.An interesting feature of the topic of this case is that there is no prescribed set of information available to us about what students at particular ages know about the Jurassic Period. Whether using a lecture or a more interac­tive format, a teacher working with these plans will need to attend to what students can talk about and how to use this information to inform subsequent lessons—in fact, such at­tention is critical to work with even the most well-docu­mented subject matter. Were information available to the teacher about the sequence through which students pass in understanding (and misunderstanding) the Jurassic Period, the teacher would still need to consider what the particular students in his or her class understood and what they needed to figure out in order to understand what distin­guishes the Jurassic from any other period.The information missing from these formats is a de­scription of who the students are as a group and as individ­uals. Information about students needs to be collected continuously and revised in the process of teaching. This information is omitted here in order to call attention to the role of students in instruction generally, and, more specifi­cally, to focus attention on the instructional format.^ Here, I am referring primarily to the culture of learning that characterizes a school, but clearly the culture of learning for any given student also includes the input of his or her home environ­ment (DiMaggio, 1982; Greenfield & Cocking, 1994) and/or the culture of the specific subject matter (Schoenfeld, 1987).^The Internet Resource Center can be found at: http://forum .swarthmore.edu/~steve/.JLDevelopmental Psychology and Instruction 217Lecture FormatThe teacher begins the first class with an explanation that the students will be studying the Jurassic Period. She or he asks them what they know about the time period called the Jurassic Period and writes their ideas on the board. This brainstorming serves as a kind of pretest, and provides a gauge for the teacher to use in thinking about what the stu­dents already know and where the explanation needs to start.^ The teacher then explains that people who study such time periods are called paleontologists or geologists, and gives examples of the kinds of investigations they con­duct and what this would mean for studying a particular pe­riod such as the Jurassic. The class closes with a review of the information covered. As homework, students are to write a “dino-fact” each day in a dino-journal they will compile during the unit. They can use information from sources found either in the classroom or at home.During other parts of the school day students:1. Work on “dinosaur math.” They are taught about appro­priate units of measure, ratio, the use of perspective and scale, and eventually are asked to compare their find­ings with what humans of the current “period” (people living today) know;2. Each student individually writes a chapter book using information that has been gathered about dinosaurs;3. Participate in an interactive Web-based project devel­oped especially for the class, in which they can ask questions of and receive answers from a current gradu­ate student in geology, “Dr. Dino”; and4. Explore texts and virtual museums via the Internet Re­source Center.Interactive FormatThe teacher begins the first class with a brief overview of the topic to be studied; students will be working to figure out what makes the Jurassic the Jurassic. The teacher then asks the students to brainstorm what they know that they know, what they think they know, and what they want to find out about the Jurassic Period. Large sheets of paper are taped up on the wall and the teacher writes all of the’It may already be obvious to the reader, but if not: The purpose of this case description is to emphasize that a lecture format can be developmentally appropriate depending on the strengths and needs of the students and the particular lecture format used. As such, this lecture format intentionally bears only some resem­blance to the stereotype of lectures as teacher-directed learning for which students need to be accomplished learners.students’ ideas under appropriate headings as directed by the students.Following this, students are led into a discussion of the­ory and facts: What do they consider to be evidence that they know something? The discussion continues, and the terms hypothesis and theory are introduced as students consider how to go about moving things from one category to the next. How could we do this? How does one develop confidence in one’s decisions? These questions lead in turn to a discussion of where we get our facts: Who does the work necessary to gather facts? How do people do this work? Only after students have offered what they already know does the teacher supplement and summarize the an­swers given by students to each of these questions.Summary statements are written on additional big sheets of paper and taped on other sections of the wall so that they will be available to the students for the next sev­eral days. These sheets will be reposted later for subse­quent discussions that build on this information. The five or six items that remain under “what they want to find out” provide the focus for the students’ learning during the unit.As homework, students are to collect dino-facts for a class dino-challenge that they have elected to set for them­selves: They aim to amass 500 dino-facts by the end of the unit. Part of their responsibility in completing this assign­ment is to note with whom they have conferred in asserting that a fact entered is indeed a fact. This portion of the as­signment is also based on their collective decision that for their purposes one other student and an adult need to verify that a fact is a fact.Student responses to the questions are used to select tasks, establish the level of questioning, and so on, for the first days of the course during which students will be in­volved in simulations (i.e., a geologic dig), projects (em­bedding fossils in a terrarium to depict geologic layers), ecosystem modeling (each student is given a slip of paper with a role written on it and must find others to whom he or she would relate), small group brainstorming, fact find­ing, and discussions of period, evolution, and geologic change.During other parts of the week students:1. Work on “dinosaur math.” They think of all of the ques­tions they might have about different dinosaurs: how big, how long, how heavy, how much did they eat, how fast did they eat? They work with and help to determine appropriate units of measure, and use of perspective and scale. They will eventually compare their findings with what humans of the current period know, and study ratio.218 Developmental Psychology and Instruction: Issues From and For Practice2. Each student works on writing a chapter book using in­formation gathered about dinosaurs.3. Students participate in an interactive Web-based project developed especially for the class in which the students can ask questions of and receive answers from a current graduate student in geology, “Dr. Dino.”4. Students explore texts and virtual museums via the In­ternet Resource Center.Linking the Case Formats to Topics in Developmental PsychologyAs is reflected in both of these case formats, many differ­ent lines of research in developmental psychology can be relevant to instructional practice. Both the lecture and the interactive formats include possibilities for drawing out and allowing for (a) information students already possess about either prehistoric time periods, dinosaurs, paleontol­ogy, and so on (knowledge, comprehension, conceptual development, developmental stage, attitudes); (b) the pos­sibility that students have misunderstandings about the na­ture of history and science generally and prehistoric time periods more specifically (misconception); (c) students’ needs to reflect on what they are learning (metacognition, comprehension, conceptual development); (d) the impor­tance of exploring alternative sources of information (strategies, problem solving, concept development, the de­velopment of representational competence); and (e) the teacher’s need to inform subsequent work in the class using information about what the students already know (zone of proximal development, psychological distance).In addition, the interactive format also includes explicit consideration of (a) potential differences among students in their ability to connect to a topic (affect, interest, tem­perament, motivation, experience, individual difference, intelligence, knowledge); (b) potential differences among students in both skills and discourse-knowledge (indepen­dence, attentional capacity, memory, implicit knowledge, expertise, ability level, strategy use); (c) opportunities to work together as a group (intercultural orientation, gender, social cognition, peers, peer relations, friendship, coopera­tion); (d) the use of a group to provide assistance and support that enables information to be learned (cognitive change); (e) opportunities to enhance students’ self­understanding (self-esteem, self-concept, self-perception, social development); (f) the use of a group to provide dif­ferent perspectives on a given task (representational com­petence, strategy use); and (g) the opportunity to make connections between the world outside and the content of school learning (situated learning).The Format of Instruction and Conceptions of LearningIn addition to reflecting links to topics in developmental psychology, the lecture and interactive formats for instruc­tion may also be understood as reflecting two “ideal,” if implicit, conceptions of learning—ideal in the sense that they are exemplars or idealized scripts (Greenfield, 1994),not in the sense that either is necessarily correct (Ben-Lecture FormatThose subscribing to the lecture format might be said gen­erally to equate learning with acquisition of a hierarchy of materials and skills (Gagne, 1968). It is not necessarily ex­pected, however, that what is learned will become part of the repertoire of the students’ knowledge without system­atic practice. Nor is it assumed that learning will lead to a qualitative shift in the students’ understanding of the infor­mation. More typically, in the mind of the practitioner, the content of what is learned in a lecture is discrete and prescribed. The product is known. There is a particular amount of text that needs to be covered, a set number of ex­periments to run or problems to be done. The teacher is per­ceived to need to move through content at the pace that has been set by someone beside him- or herself (the grade level administrator, the district). The pace often precludes se­quencing the material to meet the strengths and needs of the students, in turn affecting the likelihood that some stu­dents will not fully understand the material covered and that others will be bored with what for them is repetition.From this perspective, culture, gender, interest, moti­vation, and task orientation are considered to be differing types of intervening variables. It is thought that if students are better prepared, more motivated, or more task- oriented, they will be more effective learners (Pintrich & Schunk, 1995). The emphasis is on self-regulation and the acquisition or mastery of material, not on connections and reconstruction of what had been understood.Empirical models often fit the conception of learning specified by the lecture method, where the task and the abil­ities of the students are not necessarily matched. The goal in such data collection is to compare students with respect to their abilities, motivational orientations, learning strategies, and so on. Such studies are designed to ascertain what stu­dents can and cannot do, the strategies they employ, and the implicit knowledge they have. While such work contributes to our abilities to map student capacities as a function of age, experience with the task, and so on, they may not map directly onto optimal classroom instruction, even thoughDevelopmental Psychology and Instruction 219they are embodied in the way some educators think and teach. The reason for this is that they may show what was accomplished, but do not provide information about on what a particular student is currently working, or the kinds of learning on which he or she is ready to embark (Gardner, 1991; R. Mitchell, 1992; Perrone, 1991). Furthermore, stu­dent assignment to groups as a function of performance may not account for the importance of social and emotional well-being for cognitive functioning and the reduction of differences to dichotomies such as strong student/weak student or high achiever/underachiever. Such dichotomies often precondition students’ abilities to continue to func­tion effectively in the situation as learners and/or their abilities to develop some revised sense of themselves as learners (Eder, 1981; Harter, 1983).Interactive FormatThose who subscribe to more interactive methods of teaching consider learning to be an ongoing process of making mean­ing (acquiring skills, information, and self-knowledge). It is thought to evolve across a wide range of settings and emerges in participation (Rogoff, 1997) or through facilita­tion by others, text, and/or materials.Interactive formats for learning often are described as involving students as partners in learning. They ascribe the role of facilitating student learning to the teacher. In the mind of the practitioner, there is no expectation that stu­dents can learn any faster than they are ready and able to consolidate what they do know about concepts being cov­ered. Thus, rather than entire bodies of knowledge, selec­tion of content to be learned reflects teacher perceptions of students’ needs to begin to develop facility with particular concepts and skills (cf. Griffin, Case, & Siegler, 1994). The expectation here is that provision of tools matched to their development (in other words, tasks that challenge but do not overwhelm them) will enable students to revise or qualitatively change the way in which they have been thinking. Once the student has “learned” something, it can be assumed to be part of his or her repertoire for subse­quent learning. From this perspective, practice may include varied opportunities to continue work with a concept; be­cause tasks are sequenced to enable students to build on what they do understand, practice also can be thought about as embedded in the next sets of tasks with which they engage.Furthermore, based on a host of moderating variables (e.g., culture, gender, interest, motivation, and task orien­tation), it is expected that students will have a range of use­ful perspectives on which to draw in considering topics being covered, and that they will take different amounts oftime to consolidate information. As a result, tasks for this type of instruction are often somewhat open-ended and include opportunities to engage in multiple types of repre­sentation (cf. anchored instruction; Goldman, Pellegrino,& Bransford, 1994; distanced instruction: Copple et al., 1984; principle-based learning: Brown & Campione, 1994; project-based learning: Blumenfeld et al., 1991; thematic- based learning: Gamberg, Kwak, Hutchings, & Altheim, 1988; Katz & Chard, 1989). The tasks can account for what the student and the class are ready to learn and what would be too discrepant a challenge (Vygotsky, 1978), and can in­volve students in explicit consideration of what they are learning and why they are learning it (Countryman, 1992, Scardamalia, Bereiter, & Lamon, 1994). Such methods typically emphasize students’ abilities to access and pro­cess the tasks they are assigned; however, they may also overlook the quality of the learning engaged if clear goal structures are not established (see Anderson, Reder, & Simon, 1996). It is possible for interactive classes to con­strain learning because they are not matched to students strengths and needs (see Cobb, 1995). Teachers sometimes use an interactive task more for personal reasons (i.e., they like doing a simulation of a presidential election, or want to use the simulation they have developed on cell mitosis) rather than because it meets appropriate learning goals for students. Furthermore, teachers may overlook the needs of students to process or reflect on such learning, leaving stu­dents unaware that they have been working on understand­ing particular concepts or skills. Thus, even though the interactive format may technically involve the students as “partners” in learning, the partnership needs to be facili­tated by a teacher. Adjustment and sequencing of instruc­tion is necessary in order to maximize learning for each group of students.CommentOn paper, it appears that a singular difference between the lecture and interactive formats of instruction as reflecting conceptions of learning is the perceived relation between the task to be learned and the student. Students exposed to the lecture format may not have the background of skills and discourse-knowledge necessary to engage the lecture and/or the tasks they are assigned, and may therefore not be in a position to learn them in a lecture format. On the other hand, students involved in interactive classrooms are as­sumed to differ in their preparation for the discussion and so on, and this difference of perspective is thought to con­tribute to the development of each student’s understanding and eventual consolidation of the information to be learned.220 Developmental Psychology and Instruction: Issues From and For PracticeIn practice, however, most classes do not feature exclu­sively either a lecture or an interactive format, and one lec­ture or interactive class is not exactly the same as any other (Good, Grouws, Mason, Slavings, & Cramer, 1990). Some combination of these formats is often employed by teach­ers in order to pose particular challenges or respond to the specific needs of students.Similarly, while “the lecture” or “the interactive class” appears to reflect particular assumptions about student learning, it is not a given that these assumptions will be ar­ticulated and used to inform practice and research. It is possible for predominantly lecture classes and predomi­nantly interactive classes to meet the strengths and needs of the students being taught.Mere knowledge that one or the other format is used in a class is no indication of the quality of the connections the student is able to make to the material being learned or the basis this provides for problem posing and problem solving. Ultimately, formats of instruction are probably most accurately thought about as descriptions of potential practice. Whether they will meet the strengths and needs of students in a given class depends on how they are used.Formats of Instruction and Students’Strengths and NeedsAlthough both lecture and interactive formats can be used to meet students’ strengths and needs, they reflect impor­tant differences in the kinds of problems or tasks (complex thinking) they pose for students. On the one hand, the lec­ture format requires that students actively pose challenges and questions for themselves about the material being cov­ered (by posing “self-questions” or questions they ask themselves; taking notes that paraphrase the lecture; and stretching themselves and their thinking as they listen). On the other hand, the interactive format provides a context in which the student works on developing a knowledge of and an ability to pose questions specific to the subject matter. Ideally, interactive formats provide students with opportu­nities to develop skills and discourse-knowledge as well as a small enough group of students (i.e., 2 to 4 students) with whom to talk and work through the information to be learned.Differences among students necessitate differences in the formats that would be considered optimal for them at the beginning of a term (cf. Heath, 1986; Hunt, 1961; Michaels, 1981). There can be vast differences between classrooms of students in terms of prior knowledge, metacognitive awareness, and self-concept, including a sense of possibility, as can readily be seen when juxtaposingstudents from a housing project being schooled in the inner city and students helping to develop the curriculum they are learning in a progressive private school.It may be most appropriate to think about effective in­struction as embodied in tbe ability to teach using the plans specified in both the lecture and the interactive for­mats, depending on the strengths and needs of the stu­dents. Such strengths and needs might include the ability to function witbin a group, to listen, to use information, to set tasks for themselves, and to ask questions. For some students, they might include the ability to sit down, focus on a task, and use words to describe the problem on which they are working.Thus, instruction, in the sense that it is used here, refers to teaching that enables students to engage new questions, revise current understanding, learn appropriate skills, and recognize that they have the tools necessary for further learning. It involves thinking about the lesson from the per­spective of the student and gauging what students do and do not understand (Leinhardt, 1993). It also acknowledges that while students may prefer a particular instructional format and, in fact, perform “best” in that context (Dunn, Giannitti, Murray, Rossi, Geisert, & Quinn, 1990), differ­ent instructional formats afford different challenges for students—each of which needs to be considered seriously.The way in which students have previously been taught may be predictive of what at least initially is considered to be optimal instruction for them regardless of their grade level. This is not to suggest that any group of students should experience either lecturing or interactive teaching continuously: the different formats represent complemen­tary sets of challenges. No group has exhausted its possi­bilities in terms of the skills or discourse-knowledge it could develop—nor, by definition, will it.The suggestion that some students are not ready to un­dertake problem solving as an educational goal, or that such an expectation is a violation of culture (Delpit, 1988), calls attention to the fact that, in some classrooms, students will have no idea what you are talking about if you ask them what they would like to know about the Jurassic Period. Furthermore, there may be a cultural predisposition to ex­perience the interactive format as lacking in seriousness or importance (D’Amato, 1996). Students with this kind of reaction, at first at least, will never follow through on an assignment to confirm that a fact they have proposed is a fact, either because the assignment is not well matched to their questions, or because they are not themselves in a po­sition to assume responsibility for this kind of learning.This does not mean that these students should never be challenged to set and pose problems for themselves such asDevelopmental Psychology and Instruction 221those that would be required of them in a more interactive format. It does suggest, however, that a teacher might feel that he or she could best meet the needs of the students in such settings by beginning to teach the class using a plan similar to that specified in the lecture format—especially if this type of teacher-directed instruction is a match for their (and their parents’) expectations of school. While this kind of lecture or direct instruction is unlikely to lead stu­dents to pose challenges and questions for themselves ini­tially, the format provides them with necessary strategies for task completion, and does not ask them to assume re­sponsibility for which they are not ready (Roehler, Duffy, & Meloth, 1986). In fact, it can provide the students with the self-confidence and necessary strategies to begin pos­ing and finding solutions to questions they have about the materials being taught (Gaskins, Ehri, Cress, O’Hara, & Donnelly, 1997). This approach has a high level of success, especially when the teacher follows through to teach the students explicitly the cognitive strategies in the context of their work on subject matter (Pressley et al., 1990).Instruction, then, can gradually be adjusted to involve students in a more interactive format. Instructional conver­sations (Osterman, Christensen, & Coffey, 1985; Williams, 1986), reciprocal teaching or principle-based instruction (Brown & Campione, 1994; Palincsar & Brown, 1984), jig­saws (Aronson, Blaney, Stephen, Sikes, & Snapp, 1978), or even simple “buzz” groups and brainstorms (cf. Cohen, 1988) are all examples of interactive formats that provide a scaffold for students to begin to assume more responsibility for their learning. Through such formats, students develop the necessary capacities for more independent learning such as that posed by interactive formats or lectures.It is a rule of thumb that within three weeks of gradually adjusted instructional expectations, a shift in instructional practice can be realized (can work well) even for a large group of students.* For change in student learning to occur, however, the process of student learning needs to be under­stood as a kind of “construction zone” (Newman, Griffin, & Cole, 1989), in which student’s (or the group of students’) capacities, skills, and self-understanding are in the process* Consistent use of the Jigsaw method in teachers’ classes over a three-week period was typically found to be enough time to en­able students to accommodate to the changed role requirements introduction of this method necessitated (Aronson et al., 1978). In my own work with student teachers, I also have found that 3 weeks is long enough to enable some real change to occur (as long as it is accurately gauged and facilitated). It is also long enough for student teachers to appreciate that the change cannot occur overnight or without support from them.of change, and for which students need to develop the nec­essary strategies with which to work on the tasks they are assigned. This involves teachers in ongoing revisions of their understanding of students’ strengths and needs, and involves consideration of how students are thinking about themselves as learners (Harter, 1983; Wittrock, 1986). Furthermore, it necessitates an awareness that the time in­volved in changed understanding or abilities may well ex­tend beyond the parameters of any one marking period.Development and the Selection of Instructional FormatsStudent Learning: A SynthesisDevelopmental theories describe the process of learning as continuous and characterized by sequences or identifiable patterns of action that reflect an increasing ability to work with complexity (cf. across and between domains: Feld­man, 1980; in terms of conceptual structures: Case, 1985; intelligence: Piaget, 1950; moral development. Damon, 1988; representation: Karmiloff-Smith, 1992; self-concept [the self-system]: Harter, 1983; skill development: Fischer, 1980; social knowledge: Turiel, 1993; and strategy devel­opment: Siegler, 1997). The process of learning is also de­scribed as being both dynamic and spirallike (cf. Bruner, 1977; Karmiloff-Smith, 1992; Nelson, 1997; Newman, Griffin, & Cole, 1989; Resnick & Ford, 1981; Sigel & Kelley, 1988; Sternberg, 1985; Voss & Schauble, 1992; Vy­gotsky, 1978; Werner, 1978). The student receives infor­mation, begins to internalize (or processes) it, and uses this understanding to revise his or her present understanding and to seek out new information. Each concept and skill acquired contributes to what might be considered the build­ing blocks of an even richer or more synthetic understand­ing. This progression or sequence characterizes student learning across both broad categories of and more discrete or microlevel aspects of tasks, ranging from learning to hide a comic book behind the text being used in the class to figuring out how to say what a math problem is asking.It is important to note, however, that students who have been assigned a particular task can not necessarily be as­sumed to be working on learning the kinds of things that the teacher (or researcher) intends (Bullinger & Chatillon, 1983; Gelman, 1994; Lave & Wenger, 1991). Furthermore, there seems to be no guarantee that students will always function at the highest level of complexity of which they are capable (Azmitia, 1996; Fischer, 1980), although it does appear that students are likely to engage complex activity in their work with identified objects of interest222 Developmental Psychology and Instruction: Issues From and For Practice(identified based on their stored knowledge and stored value for these classes of objects; see Krapp & Fink, 1992; Prenzel, 1992; Renninger 1990; Schiefele, 1990). Interest has been found to influence the way in which students en­gage and perform on tasks; the demands they understand the tasks to include; the knowledge that a student is in a position to carry to subsequent activity; and the way in which a student works with others especially under condi­tions that require persistence (see Renninger, 1992, for an overview). Of particular importance is the repeated finding that while students can be identified as having and sharing interests, among students, interest is most likely to vary from one student to the next—as such, each student’s inter­est appears to inform the kind of information to which he or she attends and is largely specific to the individual. This finding provides support for the need to not only recognize but to work with individual variation in learning and its im­pact on students’ abilities to access the tasks they are as­signed. As Good, Slavings, Harel, and Emerson (1987) point out, students within the same classroom typically do not all experience instruction in the same way, nor are ma­terials appropriately adjusted to accommodate their learn­ing needs.Indeed, it appears that there is no one particular se­quence of subgoals, strategies, and so on, through which each student will pass in learning to perform a task (Nel­son, 1997; Perry, Church, & Goldin-Meadow, 1988; Resnick, 1988; Siegler, 1995; Siegler & Jenkins, 1989). In the process of coming to understand something, students may at first seem to understand it but then appear not to understand it before finally having clarity about it (Baird & Northfield, 1992; see also Bidell & Fischer, 1992; Karmiloff-Smith, 1992; Kuhn, Amsel, & O’Loughlin, 1988; Siegler, 1997). Thus, while a range of students’ likely responses/actions in working with concepts to be learned and the order of their occurrence can be identified, and students can be expected to move or cycle through these in a similar order (Case, 1996; Fischer & Pipp, 1984), it cannot be expected that students will all go about work­ing with the tasks through which they “acquire” these con­cepts in exactly the same way. The teacher needs to be able to attend to the connections and questions the students have about the tasks and concepts to be learned.The processes involved in working with a task or prob­lem—where a problem is some challenge perceived by the student in a task—specifically require the student to first identify what the problem involves. Following this, students need to be able to recognize component parts or features of the problem and invoke and/or learn the requisite skills for its solution, sequence the components of the problem inorder to facilitate their work on it, allocate time to the problem and make decisions about the quality of effort nec­essary for its completion, monitor progress toward obtain­ing a solution, and work with feedback in order to revisit it, if necessary (see also Mayer, 1984; Perkins, 1992; Polya, 1945; Sternberg, 1985).The problem solving in which students engage also in­volves them in developing an understanding of themselves as learners, members of a class, and contributors to the body of known information about the particular topic being covered. As students approach later elementary and middle school, their self-concept affects the attention they give and the choices they make about problems they take on, as well as whether they consider a change in capacity to be likely (Damon & Hart, 1988; Harter, 1983; Helmke, 1994; Krapp, 1997; Markus & Wurf, 1987). The messages stu­dents receive from others and the organization of the learn­ing environment contribute to how they come to understand themselves as problem solvers, persons in the world with interesting ideas, collaborators, people entitled to ask ques­tions, and so on (Deci & Ryan, 1985; Fend, 1994; Markus & Nurius, 1986).As Siegler’s (1997) data suggest, student innovation can follow both success and failure. If a student does not also understand this, he or she may impose constraints on what can be learned. Teachers can work to minimize or elimi­nate such constraints. To do so, however, they need to as­sume responsibility for the well-being of the student in addition to defining themselves as teachers of a subject area. Deci, Connell, and Ryan (1989) report that as com­pared to teachers who control student behavior, teachers who support students’ abilities and feelings of possibil­ity—their self-determination—positively influence their students’ feelings of competence, self-esteem, and intrin­sic motivation. Not only is it important that a teacher acknowledge students’ feelings and attitudes, but such acknowledgment also provides support for autonomy (Williams & Deci, 1996), encouraging students to initiate activity rather than asking them to conform or behave. In turn, such initiation leads to better integration and inter­nalization of the material to be learned (e.g., Deci, Eghrari, Patrick, & Leone, 1994).To return to the case formats, then, the decision to use either a lecture method or a more interactive class format for instruction involves not only whether (given a particu­lar format) the student is ready to pose challenges for him- or herself, but also the kind of teacher-student relationship afforded by the particular format (see discussions about the importance of teacher-student relationships in Harter, 1983; Kontos, 1992; Minuchin & Shapiro, 1983; Pianta &Developmental Psychology and Instruction 223Steinberg, 1992). A traditional lecture will not foster stu­dents’ feelings of self-determination and autonomy unless the students possess enough knowledge to “stay with it” and have a clear sense that questions can always be posed at its conclusion. Similarly, an interactive class will not necessarily foster students’ feelings of self-determination or autonomy unless they understand the goal of the lesson and their role in it (Slavin, 1983).Students who are having difficulty learning are often stuck at the point of entry, unable to say what the problem or task is (Flavell, 1977), or wondering whether they are in a position to take it on (Fend, 1994). Even when they com­plete practice problems, write an essay or a lab report, and so on, students are often unclear about what they are learn­ing, why it is important, and that they can, in fact, under­take the challenge it represents (Tobias, 1990). Without such information they can only skim the surface of what could be learned.At the very least, it appears that such students need in­struction that provides them with guidance as they engage the problem solving that they are assigned by helping them to know how to generate questions and summarize the in­formation they are learning (Alvermann, 1981; Midi & An­derson, 1986; Paris, Cross, & Lipson, 1984; Raphael & Pearson, 1985), and by providing them with opportunities to revisit and consolidate newly learned information by using previously learned information as a basis for intro­ducing new material in a lecture, or by posing it as a basis from which students may do problem solving, undertake a discussion, and so on, in a more interactive class (Kroll & Black, 1989).Part of being an effective problem solver includes con­structing and using strategies that work and getting rid of those that do not (Schoenfeld, 1987). This process involves students in developing an awareness about the way in which they learn and the resources or strategies necessary to es­tablish connections between information to be learned and that which the students already know. This process has been variously labeled reflective thinking (Dewey, 1933) or metacognition (cf. Flavell, 1977; see also Weinert & Kluwe, 1987). The process of becoming an effective problem solver is ongoing. It can be facilitated by instruction that involves students in reflection such as questioning and summariz­ing, and strategy instruction in which these skills have been embedded into the subject matter to be learned (see Pressley et al., 1990, for elementary level applications; Wood, Woloshyn, & Willoughby, 1995, for secondary level applications). Not surprisingly, students who are consid­ered to be successful are likely to have better understand­ing of themselves as problem solvers and the problems to belearned. Ellis (in press) points out, however, that those who evidence little awareness about strategies can select appro­priate strategies and those who are able to talk about strategies may not. She suggests that available strategies consist not only of those that have been “taught” but also those learned working and watching others solve similar problems. As such, students’ choices and awareness of par­ticular strategies reflect information about what their school and/or their individual culture decrees is “appropri­ate, adaptive, and wise.” (p. 5)In the case of the Jurassic Period lecture format, for ex­ample, students are led to reflect on their learning when they review the information covered in the lecture and when they work on writing their chapter book about dinosaurs. In the interactive format, students’ reflections are used to frame the sequence of questions in which they engage, their summation of information on the “big paper,” their writing of the chapter book on dinosaurs, the process of certifying that a fact is a fact, and so on.What students attend to and the challenges they repre­sent to themselves in these tasks are linked to the accessi­bility of the task, the skills and strategies available to engage or process the task, and the likelihood that the task completed will be the task the teacher intended. Thus, the selection of a format for instruction presumably should be informed by whether students can access tasks, the way in which they work with them, and the nature of their work on similar tasks in the past.Task Access and Student Process as Influences on PerformanceAs Gardner (1985) has pointed out, there are two ways in which we can describe the developing knowledge base about how students learn. The first specifies the impor­tance of the process involved in how students connect to or access tasks, while the second focuses on what it takes for that engagement to work.Many kinds of student characteristics have been found to affect the accessibility of tasks (see Karmiloff-Smith, 1992; Prawat, 1989). Among them are the match of the task to the student’s ability for that task (cf. Glaser, 1987; Rohrkemper & Bershon, 1984; Stein, Leinhardt, & Bickel, 1989), belief (Pintrich & DeGroot, 1990), cultural inde­pendence or interdependence (Greenfield, 1994), gender (Golombok & Fivush, 1994; Hoffmann & Haussler^ 1995), individual interest (cf. Krapp & Fink, 1992; Renninger, 1992), learning goals (Diener & Dweck, 1978, 1980), learning related self-concept or self-esteem (Helmke, 1994), misconceptions (Chinn & Brewer, 1993; Perkins & Simmons, 1988), niche (Gauvain, 1995), prior knowledge(cf. Brown, Palincsar, & Purcell, 1986; Palincsar & Brown, 1984), situational interest (Hidi & Baird, 1988; Wade, 1992), social class (Anyon, 1980), task orientation (Nicholls, 1984; Nolan, 1988), temperament (cf. Carey, 1995), understanding of the task assigned (Bullinger & Chatillon, 1983; Gelman, 1994; Lave & Wenger, 1991), and understanding of societal or institutional norms (Perret-Clermont, Perret, & Bell, 1991). The way students access tasks influence how they will be able to process them. Instructional practice can be adjusted to increase the likelihood of task accessibility (cf. adjustment of task in­terest and task difficulty; Renninger, 1992; instructional methods: Stein et al., 1989; reciprocal teaching: Brown, Palincsar, & Purcell 1986).The process of working on tasks is further influenced by students’ implicit method (Berg, 1994), metacognitive awareness (cf. Schoenfeld, 1985; Palincsar & Brown, 1984), planning ability (cf. Ericsson & Simon, 1980; Gau- vain & Rogoff, 1989; Scholnick & Freedman, 1987), and use of strategies (cf. Gaskins, 1994; Pressley, El-Dinary, Marks, Brown, & Stein, 1992; Siegler & Jenkins, 1989). For purposes of application, consideration of students abilities to process or work through a task can suggest methods for adjusting instructional practice to increase the likelihood of task completion (cf. reciprocal teaching, modeling, and apprenticeship; see Collins, Brown, & New­man, 1989, for an overview; strategy instruction: Gaskins, 1994; Pressley et al., 1992). The ability (skills, strategies, self-confidence, etc.) to work on (or process) a task, places a student in the position of being able to complete the task assigned. It also leads to the increased accessibility of other tasks. If a student is not able to access the task as it is posed, he or she has little chance of learning it. The very range of task access and process variables that have been examined and their direct relation to student performance and subsequent task access provides compelling support for the need to consider seriously the role of individual varia­tion in what students learn. It also suggests that task access is of considerable importance for thinking about the in­struction that is employed.Tasks that afford multiple opportunities for access and reengaging topics (Brown & Campione, 1994; Goldman et al., 1994) provide a wider range of opportunities for stu­dent access. Open-ended tasks can be structured in order to provide opportunities for students to learn and strengthen skills, develop subject matter knowledge, and enhance their knowledge about themselves as learners (cf. Brown & Cam­pione, 1994). They also require students to develop their representational competencies, since the organization of224 Developmental Psychology and Instruction; Issues From andsuch tasks require the student to explore a variety of prob­lem solutions (cf. Copple et al., 1984). They can be struc­tured to enable all students to have a role or function in the task and, as such, permit students to progress through and engage challenges at levels of difficulty matched to their readiness.In those instances where students are particularly disaf­fected and/or the tasks assigned to students are more closed and do not involve multiple points of access, infor­mation about patterns that emerge from study of individual variation in task access is critical for mapping student functioning. Furthermore, identification of those elements of tasks and/or particular task difficulties or strategies that vary between students would provide critical insights about what is malleable and what might therefore be a good tar­get for intervention or task adjustment.Study of these variables within student levels and with respect to individualized levels of task difficulty across different subject areas, in particular, should provide useful data about the generalizability of their effects and ways in which they may moderate student learning. This does not, however, mean that all tasks or all instruction needs to be individualized for each student (although this is reasonable for purposes of one-on-one work); rather, from such data, the teacher gains information about patterns of variation in development useful for understanding the range of stu­dent variation in the given classroom and sequencing strat­egy instruction. Based on such information, instruction can be and optimally would be individualized for classes of students.Other subtle but no less important influences on student learning include: (a) the problem finding and problem pos­ing that is modeled for students (Collins, Brown, & New­man, 1989), (b) on what the students are ready to work, and (c) the ability of the teacher to provide supports, or scaffolding, for students that enables them to reconstruct what had been understood in relation to new information. (See Hunt & Minstrell, 1994, for classroom examples and further discussion.)CommentMany of the studies on which this synthesis draws are based on children in experimental situations rather than classrooms. These children varied in age, capacities, and the context in which they were studied. Moreover, the chil­dren were typically studied in groups, even though they are described in terms of their individual functioning. The findings reported have been corroborated either by studies conducted in different contexts or by the same researchersFor PracticeDevelopmental Psychology and Instruction 225across several samples of students, so that it seems reason­able to consider them seriously in an effort to describe how students learn.By now it also should be quite clear that it is no simple issue to consider the implications of how students learn for instructional practice. Research efforts corroborate some of the difficulties that teachers experience in classrooms, namely that students differ much more than we originally might have thought, and that it is not easy to focus students on what we want them to “get” out of the tasks we assign them. Research efforts also suggest that, rather than stop­ping at observation and more standardized measures, we need to talk with students about what they are thinking as they work on problems, concern ourselves with students as developing selves, and think about the instructional format as a kind of tool and its implementation as a process of responding to students’ strengths and needs.The present synthesis, however, focuses primarily on how students go about “getting” the information they are to learn. It does not tell us much about what a student needs to get when they are learning, nor what this would mean for the way that decisions might be made about instruction when learning is understood to continue beyond the end of the marking period. There are two reasons for this. The first has to do with the importance and relevance of the content of subject matter to the discussion of what students learn. The materials and skills that are covered in a class fall into the category of curriculum, which, as noted ear­lier, is the topic of other chapters in this Handbook. The second reason is linked to the status of research in the field. What students get from their learning is yoked to what are perceived to be prior questions about the processes involved in learning. Thus, research on student learning primarily addresses how students get information. There is little developmental work that addresses what needs to be attained.In their review of the literature on students’ abilities to transfer their knowledge and skills from one situation to another situation, Mayer and Wittrock (1996) suggest that learning (premised on a problem-oriented view of learn­ing) is successful if, upon its completion, the student is in a position to generate or revisit a problem and can use his or her developing base of skills to monitor this effort. It would appear to follow, then, that to the extent that students are not using the specific skills and knowledge that are intended, the process of instruction needs to be adjusted. In practice, as Pressley et al. (1990) note, stu­dents appear to be most likely to learn and be able to apply strategies appropriately when strategy instruction isembedded in the content being taught (cf. Palincsar & Brown, 1984; Roehler et al., 1986).We really do not know the implications of direct instruc­tion for how students understand themselves as learners and what they understand the process of learning or prob­lem solving to be, especially in the long run. Furthermore, we do not know whether there is a discrete set of patterns or strategies that we might expect students to naturally em­ploy on tasks, and whether these are equally effective at a particular age or point in the process of learning something, even if they do not map exactly onto the types of strategies an expert might use in the situation. Rather than providing students with effective strategies, should we, for example, be modeling two or three alternative approaches to any given task? Should the way we work with students around use of strategies vary as a function of variables that have been identified as influencing their access to tasks, that is, age, gender, interest, the culture of schooling, or their inter- or intradependent cultural orientation? What kinds of adjustments in instruction might be suggested with re­spect to the way in which students go about working on tasks (i.e., their implicit method, planning, etc.)? Can we expect to see transfer if students have identified a problem on which they are working? What kind of range are we talking about when we say a task is appropriately matched to a student’s level of problem-solving difficulty—and what does this suggest for classes of students where the level of problem solving often varies as much as two grade levels?Until more is known about how students actually learn information, it is difficult to talk specifically about what needs to be learned and whether learning has taken place. As Mayer and Wittrock (1996) observe, the findings from study of transfer of learning have been disappointing. In many ways, it appears that information from further study of the process of learning will provide the basis of more successful efforts—but not until this research is conducted.What we do know about how students learn and the im­portant kinds of questions to ask, however, has implica­tions for practice. It suggests, for example, a shift in the emphasis of classes away from group-based practice (“second graders do”) to instruction that addresses the strengths and needs of students in the class. Furthermore, it suggests that instructional formats can be adjusted to meet students’ abilities to focus on the task assigned, that it is not the task format itself which necessarily leads to student learning, and that students’ feelings about them­selves as learners must be an important aspect of instruc­tional planning.226 Developmental Psychology and Instruction: Issues From and For PracticeIn terms of the selection of instructional formats, we know that there is probably no one instructional format that will meet each student’s strengths and needs in a class at all times. In fact, it is likely that one student’s strengths will be the needs of the next student, necessitating the use of different combinations of tasks—tasks that will allow one student to further develop strengths while another works on needs, or open-ended tasks that allow students to work on their own particular strengths and needs.As is suggested by the “best practices’’ list (cf. Bre- dekamp, 1993), it further appears that we can talk about practices that optimize the chances of students attending to the tasks we assign or present to them—although it is also important that these practices be employed in a way that is attentive to the individual strengths and needs of the stu­dents in the particular class in which they are being used.Methods such as the lecture and the interactive formats described here appear at least to afford the possibility of students (a) being allowed to define the problems or chal­lenges on which they are working, (b) employing or begin­ning to practice employing strategies that are modeled/ demonstrated for them, (c) revisiting the information being covered in various formats and contexts so that they will have it available as they need it in order to continue work­ing on a task, and (d) understanding that they have learned. From this perspective, like the process of a student work­ing on a task, the process of instruction requires focused attention and reflection. In particular, the selection of in­structional format calls for attention to and reflection on the strengths and needs of the particular group of students being taught and how they learn, and it requires informa­tion about the formats that might be employed in the class­room and the means to adjust them.®Instruction as a ProcessTwo general principles emerge from the preceding discus­sion about development and the selection of formats for instruction:1. There is often variation in the way students learn what, to an observer, appears to be essentially the same task.® For the purposes of this discussion, content knowledge is an as­sumed basis of instructional decisions in the classroom. In prac­tice, it is more reasonable to talk about the teacher’s developing content knowledge as informing and sometimes constraining de­cision making about instruction.2. There is no one right way to work effectively with stu­dents; rather, an aecumulating body of research con­tributes to our understanding of how students learn. Together with information about the strengths and needs of the students to be taught, such research can be used to inform decision making about instruction.While these principles have been tenets of many educa­tors and psychologists whose writing has focused on how students learn (cf. Dewey, 1938; Montessori, 1917/1965; Pestalozzi, 1855; Polya, 1945), they directly contradict the way most educators and researchers have themselves been taught. They focus on the skills, discourse-knowledge, and self-understanding each student has and still needs to de­velop rather than on diserete knowledge learned at specific time points according to a previously identified criterion (cf. Mager, 1962).The work of Skinner (cf. 1968) as spokesperson for Be­haviorism, for example, appears to have contributed to a notion shared by many educators that actions and reactions have only linear relations and particular answers,thus suggesting that there is a discrete number of effective ways to work with students and that there is one effective way to learn a task. In fact, Skinner’s (1968) research on learning, in particular, his emphasis on baselines of behavior and his discussions of reinforcement and contingency (often rein­terpreted) continue to inform educational practice, pre­sumably due to their simplicity, scientific presentation, and the fact that in particular situations they are useful in the elassroom. The problem is that his studies do not provide sufficient information with which to begin to consider and respond to the complexity of the processes involved in stu­dents’ emerging understanding of concepts, skills, and self-knowledge. Information about this complexity is nee- essary for developing instruction tailored to students’ changing strengths and needs.It may well have been Flavell’s (1977) volume on Piaget’s research. Cognitive Development, and Cole, John-Steiner, Scribner, and Souberman’s translation of Vygotsky’s (1978) Mind in Society, which provided the groundwork necessary to enable psychologists and educators generally to begin'“Interestingly, most educators do not read Skinner’s work in the original, but instead are introduced to his ideas through someone else’s syntheses.

The Technology of Teaching, and do not in­corporate further developments of his or other behavioral researchers’ studies.Developmental Psychology and Instruction 227reconsidering how learning might be conceptualized dif­ferently and more fully. Certainly, Bruner (1966) and his colleagues’ development of the MACOS materials, Cron- bach and Snow’s (1977) considerations of the relation be­tween aptitude and instructional method, Sarason’s (1982) analysis of the problems that arose in the effort to institute New Math, Neisser’s (1976) ecological approach to cognition, Bronfenbrenner’s (1979) ecological psychol­ogy, Jackson’s (1968) discussion of the hidden curricu­lum, Ashton-Warner’s (1963) description of literacy development, and Holt’s (1964) description of why chil­dren fail indicate that across several disciplines, it had be­come increasingly clear to many that school learning was not at all a discrete process.The Tetrahedral ModelJenkins’ (1979) scholar’s tetrahedron and its elaboration by Brown (1982) and Bransford (1979) provides a much- needed tool for those interested in going beyond the labora­tory to address learning in more natural contexts (cf. Brown et al., 1983). The tetrahedral model identifies four components of learning: (a) the characteristics of the learner (skills, knowledge); (b) learning activities (atten­tion, rehearsal); (c) criterial tasks (recognition, recall); and (d) the nature of the materials (modality, physical structure). In specifying the interdependence of these com­ponents, the model offers a check on more discrete concep­tualizations of learning that earlier stimulus-response models somewhat inadvertently sanctioned.The tetrahedral model calls attention to points also raised by Cronbach and Snow’s (1977) aptitude-treatment- interaction (ATI) and Hunt and Sullivan’s (1973) behavior- person-environment (BPE) models. The tetrahedral model, however, has broader applications than either the ATI or BPE model, since it is not limited to matching instruction to student aptitudes or behaviors. Furthermore, rather than focusing on students grouped by type, the tetrahedral model accords a dimension to individually varying student characteristics.Reminiscent of points raised by James (1890), Baldwin (1906, 1911), and Dewey (1933, 1938) in their discussions of learning, the tetrahedral model also differs from these earlier theories because it posits specific dimensions of learning for which researchers need simultaneously to be accountable. It provides a language for conceptualizing the process of learning as both dynamic and reciprocal, and points to interactions among the components or dimensions that need to be acknowledged. Furthermore, it permits con­sideration of a range of potential factors and theoretical perspectives on which an educator can draw in makingdecisions. In fact, the model has provided the theoretical foundation for several current school-based projects de­signed to investigate the contributions of cognitive science to classroom practice (cf. Bereiter & Scardamalia, 1992; Brown & Campione, 1994; Cognition and Technology Group at Vanderbilt, 1991).The model does not, however, give us more than a label for the interactions that it so clearly specifies, that is, inter­actions between the student and the task and among the student, the task, and the criteria for learning, and so on. The model gives us a general sense that adjustment of (or attention to) one component results in other components being affected, but beyond this there was no specification for action. In fact, Jenkins (1979) spoke about researcher selection of vertices for their focus as reflecting “a favorite vertex.” ... “a favorite edge for research” (p. 431).In order to inform practice, it is critical that one of the vertices under consideration represent the learner (or the community doing the learning). The learner—not the edu­cator, and not the text—consolidates and develops his or her skills and discourse-knowledge (cf. Gelman, 1994; Piaget, 1952). Understanding how text, for example, can be enhanced to increase the likelihood that students will at­tend to it is only effective if experimental manipulations take into account information about the learner as learner: prior knowledge, abilities, individual interests, and so on, in the context of a particular environment (Bronfenbrenner, 1979). Without this information, such research makes too many assumptions about individual students for these data to contribute significantly to classroom practice in useful ways over time (even though it does have a demonstrated effect on learning in the moment, cf. Wade, 1992).Psychological Distance as a Tool for Instructional PlanningThe construct of psychological distance provides an exten­sion and an elaboration of the tetrahedral model for prac­tice. Psychological distance refers to both the distance between what the learner understands and what he or she still needs to understand (intrapsychic understanding, similar to Vygotsky’s, 1978, notion of the zone of proximal development), and the ways through which others, tasks, and/or the environment facilitate learning by adjusting questions and engagements for the learner (interpsychic understanding) (Sigel, 1970; see discussion. Cocking & Renninger, 1993). These two foci always stand in relation to each other and are central to conceptions of learning and change across a wide range of theoretical models: discrep­ancy (cf. DeLoache, 1993; Werner, 1978), equilibration (cf. Piaget, 1950; Watson & Fischer, 1993), mediation (cf.228 Developmental Psychology and Instruction: Issues From and For PracticeCobb, 1995; Rogoff, 1990), and social learning (cf. Mischel & Rodriguez, 1993; Shantz, 1993).In terms of psychological distance, the individual learner (or group of learners) is described as cocreating his or her (their) learning in conjunction with the others (the teacher, other students, etc.) and objects (tasks, texts, etc.) that comprise the environment. It is individuals, in this in­stance, teachers, who actively and naturally perceive and construct an understanding of their environment (students, text, etc.). The distance or discrepancy lies between what the student understands and what he or she still needs to understand about each of the learning components speci­fied in the tetrahedral model: characteristics of student, task, teacher, and criterion.Given a question about how to facilitate student under­standing of what a paleontologist does, for example, the teacher has in the construct a tool that requires reflection upon the question (issues linked to history, paleontology, the students’ present understanding and possible miscon­ceptions) and identification of a plan of action in terms of student strengths and needs. The specifics of such instruc­tion are not fully articulated for the teacher, however—nor can they be if teachers are learning about and responding to the individual strengths and needs of their students in the process of teaching. Rather, the endpoints of psychological distance are specified and their juxtaposition enables the teacher to consider alternative responses. The educator im­poses his or her “value” on the construct and, in turn, scaf­folds him- or herself into the role of scientist or problem solver. Thus, psychological distance can be said to describe the action or change to be undertaken rather than the locus or potential sources of activity. Change is facilitated through the adjustment of instruction.Like the tetrahedral model, the construct of psychologi­cal distance reflects the complexity of the learning process and the potential of multiple lenses for evaluating learning. It provides a kind of classification scheme that facilitates attention to the patterns that arise in classroom activity, rather than being mired at an individual level (cf. Rogoff, 1997); yet it can be effectively applied to specify change at the level of individual learning as well. Distancing, or the process of using information about psychological distance to inform action, can take the form of questions posed, tasks presented, modeling, and so forth (see Sigel, 1993, for a taxonomy of verbal distancing actions). Its effective­ness is directly related to the way in which it enables the student, educator, researcher, and so on, to rerepresent in­formation (assumptions about what the student under­stands, how materials have always been sequenced, and so on). This process of rerepresenting information can beinstigated by discrepancy (Sigel & Cocking, 1977), can emerge from engaging information that is novel, surprising, complex, uncertain, or curious (Berlyne, 1960). It can also be facilitated through modeling (cf. Rogoff, 1990) and/or mediation such as that provided by small group work (Cobb, 1995) or metacognition (cf. Brown, 1978). During the process of distancing, the teacher concurrently learns about the students and the ways in which materials might be adjusted (questions posed, etc.) to facilitate further stu­dent learning either at the individual level or within a group. While the others and the objects that comprise the student’s environment affect learning by virtue of their very existence (which explains why some learning goes on in classrooms even though there may not be much attention to students’ strengths or needs), they can also serve in more explicit ways to organize or reorganize the relationship of the student to the environment.Consideration of alternate activity, as afforded by the juxtaposition in the construct of both the distance between what the student (or group of students) knows and still needs to know and what might be undertaken to work with him or her on learning it, provides for the likelihood of informed, reflective decision making about instruction. It also increases the likelihood that the tasks in which stu­dents engage will be matched to their cognitive and social strengths and, as such, be optimally challenging.Adjustment of instruction to meet the strengths and needs of students can only occur, however, to the extent that teacher practice is not simply what Berg (1994) has la­beled an implicit method. The tool of psychological dis­tance, applied to a problem that the teacher identifies, focuses attention on the teacher’s students and ideas about possible actions on their behalf. Just as an open-ended task provides multiple points of access for the student, so psy­chological distance provides the teacher with a forum for connecting to his or her students’ strengths and needs in a given classroom. Applied to the stereotype of the inner- city classroom in which, among other things, assignments are two and three grade levels above that for which the stu­dents are ready, psychological distance could focus atten­tion on the students’ readiness for: the nature of the tasks (difficulty, interest-value, and so on), the teacher’s crite­ria, and the teacher’s actions. Application of the construct involves singling out one component of the learning process at a time and considering it in terms of a particular group of students’ (or student’s) strengths and needs.Given a 40-person class of students who are not moti­vated to learn French, consideration needs to be given to: what the students’ sense of themselves as students is, their goals and what they understand about the French they areInstruction: An Overview of Research and Reports 229being taught, what the teacher expects to be mastered and what the students are ready to master, the format of in­struction, and so on. If learning is the goal, the dimensions of what currently passes as instructional practice in this classroom clearly need to be reviewed and revised.In psychological distance, both educators and re­searchers have a tool for reflecting on their activity—a tool that is dependent on their input. The constructs, including the language, that teachers and researchers have to describe teaching constitutes the set of possibilities, or repertoire, with which they have to work.In order for us to think further about the possible appli­cations of developmental psychology to practice, it is nec­essary to consider what knowledge is available to teachers to use as input were they to work with psychological dis­tance as a tool for instructional planning. At a meta-level, such information also provides the researcher (workshop leader, teacher educator, etc.) with information about the “language” teachers may have available.INSTRUCTION: AN OVERVIEW OF RESEARCH AND REPORTSIn order to consider what we know about the language of in­struction and the kind of repertoire the literature provides (or could provide) to the practitioner, an overview of recent work on the topics of large group instruction, questioning, and grouping was undertaken. These topics, or more accu­rately, these categories of topics, permit reconsideration of what we currently know about how students learn and the links between this information and practice, specifically as these bear on students’ access to, processing of, and perfor­mance on tasks they are assigned.A two-part process was involved in selecting literature for each overview. First, using ERIC and PsycINFO with SilverPlatter retrieval software, abstracts of articles ad­dressing the topics (and related headers) were selected and sets of questions or patterns characterizing each of the lit­eratures were identified. These patterns were used to in­form the organization of each overview. Finally, articles, reports, and technical documents were obtained, reviewed, and used as resources with particular attention to the inclu­sion of work that drew on different types of methodologies (case analysis, microanalysis, controlled experiment, etc.). The second part of the literature selection focused on re­views of the topic.The overviews consist of a synthesis of the issues specific to student learning. Following each synthesis is a summary and a commentary: (a) What does this overview contributeto our thinking about instructional formats depicted in the two Jurassic Period case formats? (b) What does the topic contribute more generally to how we think about student learning and its implications for instruction?, and (c) What might we still want to know about this topic based on devel­opmental theory and research? (In other words, what kind of research might usefully be undertaken?)Large Group Instruction Overview of Research and ReportsDespite a sizable literature on discussion, large group in­struction\" is discussed as though it were synonymous with lecturing. In particular, it is described as being both teacher-directed and associated with distant, unindividual­ized teaching. Articles on large group instruction generally detail ways to minimize the problems of teaching and learning in a classroom with many students and a low teacher-student ratio. Few authors speak about the advan­tage of large group instruction as a method for learning and teaching. Instead, the advantages typically specified\"Literature was searched under the following headers: Direct Instruction, Large Group Instruction, Lecture Method, Whole Group Discussion, Discussion-Teaching Technique, Group Dis­cussion, Discussion Groups.Sample: Research and reports on lecturing focus primarily on undergraduate and graduate student populations; they are re­viewed here, however, because teacher lectures or explanation constitutes such a large percentage of classroom instruction in elementary and secondary schools (up to 66% of the time in class, according to Bellack, Kliebard, Hyman, & Smith, 1966). Few considerations of lecturing evaluate either the effects of lecturing on atypical populations, race, ethnicity, or gender as possible factors in learning from lectures.Research and reports on discussion, on the other hand, focus primarily on elementary and high school populations. Studies of discussion have investigated at-risk students, adult students, and learning disabled students; few studies, however, evaluate the roles of race, ethnicity, or gender as possible factors in learning from discussions.Content Areas of Focus: Research and reports examining large group instruction and lecturing tend to be conducted in in­troductory education and biology courses, physiology and home economics courses, and medical school settings. Almost no stud­ies of large group instruction and lecturing have been conducted in foreign language classes. In contrast, studies of discussion span the disciplines, with particular emphasis on literature and reading classes, social studies, and science and foreign language classes.230 Developmental Psychology and Instruction: Issues From and For Practiceinclude such factors as (a) lowered costs, (b) efficient use of faculty time and talent, (c) availability of professional resources, and (d) standardization. Disadvantages include(a) impersonal relationships between teacher and students,(b) limited instruction, (c) management difficulties, (d) in­equity in rewards, and (e) lower status for the instructor (Chism, Cano, & Pruitt, 1989). In fact, large group instruc­tion is often described as a problem that has to be fixed, “dealt with,” or “solved.”In contrast to the literature on lectures, large group dis­cussion classes are considered to reflect a shift to student- oriented methods of teaching, permitting students to explore ideas and identify their needs as learners (Conti & Fellenz, 1988). According to Miner (1992), teachers who aim to be effective with large classes look for ways to minimize psychological and physical distance between themselves and their students in order to increase personal­ization. Solutions to the problem of large classes include peer tutoring, group work, and educator training. Pearson (1990) suggests expanding on what traditional expectations for the large group setting might include. He suggests a need for lecturers to explore opportunities for active par­ticipation; development of a supportive climate; provision of rewards for positive behavior; and presentations that in­clude auditory, sensory, and visual input.The authors of research and reports on lecturing and discussion as methods make clear distinctions between them as different methods of large group instruction. Therefore, overviews of the issues raised in studies and re­ports on each are undertaken separately.Lecture Method. Lecturing is the most common form of large group instruction. Cashin (1985) summarizes the instructional goals met by lecturing as including opportuni­ties to (a) share the instructor’s interest in the material, (b) present unavailable materials, (c) organize materials in a particular way, (d) cover a lot of information, (e) address numerous students at the same time, (f) model how profes­sionals work through discipline-based problems, (g) exer­cise control, (h) lessen the threat of direct contact with an authority, and (i) develop skills for listening. Furthermore, a variety of lecture types exist; (a) interactive lectures, which engage student thinking throughout the lesson; (b) mastery lectures, which link new knowledge to familiar concepts and ideas; and (c) traditional lectures, which pre­sent information with minimal student activity (Kuzbik, 1992). The predominant focus of research and reports on lecturing, however, is the traditional lecture.Research and reports on the lecture method appear to focus specifically on (a) comparison of lecturing to othermethods of teaching, (b) elements of the lecture that influ­ence student performance, and (c) what instructors need to do in order to be more effective in the classroom.Comparing Lecturing to Other Methods of Instruction. Studies in which the lecture method is compared to other methods of large group instruction evidence mixed find­ings. Some studies in which the lecture method is con­trasted with student performance in a pretest, posttest design indicate that students taught by the lecture method do less well than those taught using reflective methods (cf. Adyemi, 1992; Grieve, 1992). For example, students in pre­college and college algebra lecture classes scored signifi­cantly lower on post-tests than did students in a self-paced laboratory format class (Robinson, 1990). Similarly, when DaRosa et al. (1991) compared the effects of lectures and independent study on medical school students test scores and study time, they concluded that independent study should be given emphasis in the curriculum. Heywood and Heywood (1992) report, however, that high school students did no better in a variety of school subjects when taught with lecture (expository teaching) rather than discovery- based methods. Furthermore, they observed that low-abil­ity students benefited more from the expository lesson, whereas high-ability students benefitted more from the discovery lesson.The variable of ability appears to influence the impact of lectures on performance; however, the direction of its predicted effect varies. Robinson and Niaz (1991), for ex­ample, report that interactive instruction in chemistry is more effective than lectures for low-ability students. Odubunmi and Balogun (1991) also report that high- achieving eighth graders performed no differently in sci­ence laboratory or lecture classes, but low achievers in laboratory sections performed better than students in lec­ture sections, and girls in lectures performed better than boys.Other variables considered to affect student perfor­mance in lectures (or discussion) include student prefer­ences for interactive methods (cf. Heywood & Heywood, 1992), and level of instructor effectiveness (cf. Abeasi & Reigeluth, 1985). Moreover, matching student learning style with instructional method has been demonstrated to be effective, and can make the lecture classroom a success­ful learning environment for students well suited to it (Katz, 1990). According to Burns (1990), the format a teacher uses, the order of items presented, the presentation style, the timing, the pairing of items, the use of data sum­maries, and the amount of information presented all influ­ence students’ understanding as well as their recall.Instruction: An Overview of Research and Reports 231Elements of the Lecture that Affect Student Performance. Taking in all of the information conveyed in lecture classes requires well-developed listening and note taking skills. These have been found to pose particular challenges for non-native students (ESL, or English as a Second Language students) who are not as adept at processing English lan­guage quickly. Fahmy and Bilton (1990), for example, found that ESL students do not always pick up lecturers’ cues signalling key words. In addition, ESL students are not familiar with English abbreviations or shorthand, which makes their note taking difficult and prevents them from taking notes on a lot of information in a short period of time. They conclude that foreign students’ listening and note taking skills need to be improved. Another study of non-native-speaking graduate and undergraduate students conducted by Olson and Huckin (1990) provides an analy­sis of college engineering students’ immediate recall sum­maries following a videotaped lecture. Conclusions from this study also suggest that non-native-speaking students should be taught skills for listening to lectures more strategically.Findings from a few studies suggest changing the lecture format to improve students’ comprehension of information presented. One study, for example, found that two-minute pauses spaced at appropriate points in a videotape lecture were effective for enhancing both learning-disabled and nonlearning-disabled students’ performance on free-recall and objective test measures, although they did not affect longer-term recall (Ruhl, Hughes, & Gajar, 1990). Other studies suggest that questions embedded in lectures foster greater student involvement with the lecture. Fisher and Jablonski (1985) report, for example, that the type of ques­tion posed during a college lecture affects the nature of student participation. Their findings suggest that rhetorical questions allow silent involvement, since they call attention to the perspective being addressed and can provide a sum­mary of the information covered. Discussion questions, on the other hand, demand vocal involvement since they call for an analysis or evaluation of the information presented. Transition questions, in contrast, can call for either silent or vocal responses since they indicate movement to a new topic (i.e.. How might we evaluate . . . ?) and can be used to shift the focus of the lecture or to open a discussion.Another set of reports recommends enhancing lectures through the use of methods that encourage more active stu­dent involvement. Bonwell and Eison (1991), for example, suggest a modified lecture format supplemented by visual learning, writing in class, problem solving, computer-based instruction, cooperative learning, debates, drama, role playing, simulations, games, and/or peer teaching.Williams (1986) describes the “feedback lecture method” as a modification of the traditional lecture method. This approach to lecturing involves ongoing feed­back to both the student and the teacher. It includes the fol­lowing steps: (a) The teacher determines the students’ level of knowledge on a given subject by asking questions and giving feedback, (b) the teacher presents the sequential order of the lesson, (c) the teacher presents a list of tasks to be learned and clarifies uncertainties, (d) the teacher presents an overview of material to be covered, (e) the teacher teaches, (f) the students are asked to synthesize and evaluate the newly acquired material in light of their own experiences, (g) the students comprehension is as­sessed, (h) written feedback is provided to students for re­inforcement, and (i) students evaluate the instructional process and materials.In another version of a feedback lecture, a study guide is handed out before the lecture, postlecture small group dis­cussions are employed, a lecture outline is provided, and teacher notes are made available. Osterman, Christensen, and Coffey (1985) report that findings from the use of this method indicate that it models effective study skills for students and provides them with opportunities to improve their comprehension, storage, recall, and subsequent appli­cation of material.Yet another suggested adjustment to the lecture method involves asking students to self-question—having students articulate questions prior to the lecture. King (1989a), for example, reports that ninth-grade honors students got the most from a lecture when they posed self-questions during the lecture and discussed answers to their questions fol­lowing it.Making expectations for lectures explicit and paying at­tention to note taking are two more ways in which lectures can be adjusted to enable students to learn efficiently, al­though there is some dissension among researchers about whether and when students should be encouraged to take notes. Topics addressed in this literature include note tak­ing versus listening, providing notes versus generating notes, note taking efficiency, teaching note taking, and the qualities of a lecture that provide for good note taking (see reviews by Dubois, 1986; Isaacs, 1989).Anderson and Armbruster’s (1986) review of the value of note taking during lectures at college specifies the po­tential benefits to students of the kind of lecturing that permits deep processing while taking notes, provided that the tests that follow are consistent with the style of the lec­ture. They distinguish among verbatim note taking while listening, selectively noting information, and recording some meaningful reorganization of the lecture. The latter232 Developmental Psychology and Instruction: Issues From and For Practiceinvolves a deep level of processing. They further specify that the level of processing will depend on the characteris­tics of the lecture itself: Speed of presentation and the number of concepts presented also affect the difficulty of processing a lecture and taking notes. Anderson and Arm- bruster cite the usefulness of collecting and reviewing stu­dents’ notes early in the term following a lecture. This practice provides feedback about how well the lecture is being understood and which students need to be assisted to develop their note taking skills.Anderson and Armbruster (1986) recommend that students (a) take complete notes as long as this does not in­terfere with comprehension; (b) note key ideas and supple­ment this information later using the text and so on, especially if the lecture is delivered rapidly; (c) use para­phrasing or summaries of the lecture as a method of note taking in order to ensure deep processing; (d) find out about tests given previously and use these as a guide for taking and studying notes; and (e) study notes in a manner that makes it possible to use them in another situation.Walbaum (1989) further suggests that although there are potential encoding benefits of note taking (attention, as­similation of new information, and meaningful encoding; cf. Peper & Mayer, 1978), it is also likely that some stu­dents only experience one or more of these benefits and that they only do so some of the time. She notes, for exam­ple, that students are probably not experiencing coding ben­efits if they struggle to take notes during a rapidly delivered lecture. Furthermore, in note taking, low verbal students who are slow auditory processors may be per­forming a recording task that keeps them from processing lecture material meaningfully.Training for Lecturing. The process of effectively at­tending to lectures can be taught, but it appears that teach­ers need to learn to structure lectures, acknowledge the context of the information students require to learn, and in­volve themselves in the development of communication skills.Chilcoat’s (1989) review, for example, emphasizes the importance of structuring lectures to enhance student learning and subsequent achievement. He specifies the im­portance of (a) providing a preview of information prior to explanation (through overview, set induction, or ad­vanced organizer); (b) organizing information within a step-by-step lesson sequence; (c) assessing student learning when information is being given; (d) signaling transitions;(e) using multiple examples to illustrate information points;(f) stressing important points during explanations; (g) elim­inating nonessential information; and (h) frequently sum­marizing information to be learned.Murray and Murray (1992) further specify that the sys­tematic preparation of a successful college lecture includes a four-stage process of (a) anticipating student expecta­tions; (b) selecting, preparing, and sequencing the content to be presented; (c) delivering the lecture with attention to speech, demeanor, body language, and timing; and (d) sup­porting and evaluating the students’ learning.Finally, training for the improvement of lecturing skills is linked by Andrews (1989) to the development of com­munication and public speaking skills. She suggests the following objectives for helping teachers to be effective lecturers: (a) Gaining and maintaining control of the class; (b) highlighting main ideas; (c) preparing students for forthcoming activities; (d) showing interest and enthusiasm for the subject being taught; (e) providing a role model of good public communication skills; (f) acknowledging and dealing with speech anxiety; (g) anticipating the teaching environment; (h) bringing in other teaching techniques; (i) using visual aids; and (j) seeking feedback on the lecture.Discussion Method. Studies of discussion as a method for large group instruction reflect a strong commit­ment to discussion as a means of promoting students’ criti­cal thinking skills.’^ A dual assumption appears to inform this work. Namely, learning should be a responsibility shared by teachers and students, and discussions are more effective than lectures because of this. The extent to which teachers and students participate in discussions is under­stood, however, to depend on the type of discussion in which they are involved. In a cooperative learning situation or a subject mastery discussion, the teacher has been found to serve less as a participant and more as a resource expert and observer. In an issues-oriented discussion, on the other hand, the teacher assumes the role of moderator (Gall & Gall, 1993).Recent research and reports on discussion appear to be focused specifically on (a) discussion and student learn­ing (justification that students do learn during discus­sion) and (b) training teachers and students to participate in discussions.Discussion and Student Learning. Research and re­ports indicate that teachers can promote students’ critical‘^The literature distinguishes between the characteristics and effects of large and small group discussions. Since another por­tion of this paper reviews the literature on grouping and the fo­cus of the present overview is large group instruction, small group discussion will not be addressed here.Instruction: An Overview of Research and Reports 233and creative thinking and stimulate divergent thinking through the use of discussion. Structured discussions in a geography class, for example, have been used to help stu­dents (a) learn geographical concepts and critical thinking skills; (b) retain information on a long-term basis; and (c) develop interpersonal skills (Delaney, 1991). Similarly, in the science classroom, discussions can be used to carry out practical work, interpret results, and relate the results to everyday life (Solomon, 1991).Students’ background knowledge and experience have been found both to enhance their participation in discus­sions and to help them develop as thinkers (Gentile & McMillian, 1992). In their adaptation of Freire’s (1970) critical dialogue, Gentile and McMillian report that the use of topics that have direct application to the problems and ethical dilemmas that at-risk students encounter on the streets and in their houses provides them with connections between what they do understand and the subject matter they are expected to master in school. Strategies such as this also enabled Buckelew (1991) to be sensitive to each student’s experience when conducting or facilitating dis­cussions in English classes.Several methods for adjusting the way in which discus­sions are conducted have also been found to enhance stu­dent learning. These include instructional conversations, interactive discussion, and online computer discussions.Instructional conversations in which content and con­versation are combined to promote dialogue are understood to provide students with opportunities to form connections between what they do know and the learning they are un­dertaking. This serves as a kind of scaffold (or means for making connections) for students and teachers who have not had much experience with discussion-based learning. Instructional conversations are characterized as involving a thematic focus, students’ prior knowledge, direct teach­ing, complex language, few questions with known answers, students’ decisions about when to participate, and so on (ED347850, 1992). By way of example, “Questioning the Author’’ (Beck, 1997) is a technique for involving students in the ideas of a text. They are led through collaborative work to construct an understanding together with others as a response to teacher probes that require rereading for meaning and accuracy. Findings reported by McKeown, Beck, and Sandora (1994) indicate that when students work with Questioning the Author, more than half of the com­ments from students are directed toward construction of meaning, whereas student comments in baseline classrooms are more or less verbatim repetitions of text.Dillon (1982a, 1982b, 1994) suggests that students need to help direct the flow of discussion in order to construct meaning for themselves (see also Yackel, 1995). In fact, hesuggests that teachers might not want to ask questions if they wish to facilitate class discussions. Based on the typi­cal (and expected) practice of teachers to do most of the questioning in discussions, Dillon suggests that at most, teachers should pose one question at the start of a discus­sion in order to define it. By holding back, so to speak, the teacher provides room for the students to begin to own or shape the conversation based on their understanding. Dillon further suggests that any other comments or ques­tions that the teacher makes should occur only in response to his or her genuine need for clarification.The premise of interactive discussions is that teachers can work together with students as a group to develop and, where necessary, enable them to reconstruct what they un­derstand about a concept. Similar to the interactive format described for teaching about the Jurassic Period, class members assist each other and work together to both prob- lematize and make sense of discrepant or counterintuitive perspectives (see examples in Alvermann, 1991; Com- meyras, 1993; Guzzetti, Snyder, Glass, & Gamas, 1993, Roth, Anderson, & Smith, 1987).Online computer discussion can be yet another vehicle for student discussion, one that has been shown to generate a large peer audience for student work and enhanced peer performance (cf. Bump, 1990). Other technology-based vehicles for involving students in learning together include the electronic sharing of databases, student communication with identified experts on the topic being studied, and desktop video conferencing in which students work with others who are addressing similar problems (see review chapter by The Cognition and Technology Group at Van­derbilt, 1996).Studies of the quality of interaction, however, indicate that although the student needs to assume responsibility for learning, the process of the teacher’s instruction does affect how this transpires. Ahern, Peck, and Laycock (1992) studied three styles of discourse on line and quality of student participation in a computer-mediated discussion of an introductory college-level education course. They report that the instructor’s style of response was the most important factor in determining the amount of student par­ticipation and the quality of student responses. A teacher’s question posed in response to a student’s comment typi­cally led to recitation. Where the teacher reflected on or elaborated on a student’s response, spontaneous and rich discussion ensued among students, as well as between teacher and students.Similarly, Smagorinsky and Fly (1993) report that stu­dents’ functioning in small group discussions typically reflects the types of behavior modeled by the teacher dur­ing teacher-led discussions. Specifically, they suggest that234 Developmental Psychology and Instruction: Issues From and For Practiceuse of small groups for student learning provides a critical support for students’ learning to construct meaning for themselves if teachers (a) provide opportunities for stu­dents to make connections between the material to be learned and the context in which it was written (e.g., relat­ing literature to personal experiences, to current events, or through discussion of how a concept such as maturity mapped onto the material read) and (b) identify strategies necessary for critical reading (e.g., establishing the need to ask questions, provide support for points being made, etc.). They conclude that if students experience top-down sup­port for instruction, they are less likely to assume responsi­bility for their learning than if they are led to participate in interaction that encourages them to elaborate upon what they do and do not understand (see also Cobb, 1995).Not surprisingly, perhaps, the teacher’s goals for a given lesson also have been found to affect the types of discus­sion that can be held (Alvermann, O’Brien, & Dillon, 1990). In a study of 24 classroom teachers, Alvermann et al. (1990) found that discussion is typically recitation- based when its purpose is review; discussion is recitation- based or a recitation-lecture when the purpose is to define, label, or identify; and finally, discussion is open-ended (the students are encouraged to question the text or discuss the basis of “the facts”), if the purpose is the development of student comprehension. They report that these teachers’ definitions of discussion were found to correspond to the few open-ended discussions observed, although the domi­nant format for discussion among the teachers was lecture/ recitation or recitation. Interviews with the teachers re­vealed that the teachers’ concerns about being in control of their classes and covering content meant that, while teach­ers might like the idea of delving into a topic with their stu­dents, they would rarely let this happen.Training for Discussion. It appears that successful classroom discussions hinge on both teachers’ and students’ training for their respective roles in a discussion (cf. Cole­man, 1992; Mesa-Bains & Shulman, 1991; Thomas, 1992). Learning how to ask reflective questions that promote and enhance discussion must be included in such training (cf. Ciardiello, 1993). Wasserman (1992), for example, de­scribes high school social studies class discussions as “pow­erful forums” when teachers (a) are purposeful in their teaching, (b) are clear about what students need to under­stand, (c) apply principles of effective questioning, and (d) are open to further developing their questioning skills.Marshall, Klages, and Fehlman’s (1991) findings with high school students, however, suggest that teachers may have trouble running discussions and may attribute theirdifficulties to their students rather than to their own lack of skill. Specifically, they report that English teachers in middle-track high school classrooms found it difficult to run student-centered discussions. The teachers attributed their difficulties to student disinterest or inability to par­ticipate, whereas the students interviewed from these classes said that they felt that the type of student involved in these classes required the discussion to be teacher- centered. Not surprisingly, perhaps, other findings from this study include the following: (a) Teachers and students were likely to make informative statements when they held the floor, (b) students’ remarks were likely to reflect the kinds of questions the teachers asked, and (c) teachers were likely to respond to students by either acknowledging or restating what they had said.Wood’s (1995) description of the “to-ing” and “fro-ing” of a traditional teacher making her way in a reform math classroom provides further evidence of the difficulties in­volved in changing practice even when there is a high level of support for changed curricular emphasis. The teacher with whom he worked found that she struggled with a de­sire to intervene in students’ discussions when an incorrect solution was being considered, even though she conceptu­ally understood why intervening in the students’ efforts would change the nature of what they would learn. Her ex­periences underscore the importance to teachers of time, practice, changed understanding about students as learners, and support for changed curriculum in order for discussion- based classes to provide forums for classroom-based prob­lem posing and problem solving. (Once this teacher was finished her 3-month commitment to this classroom proj­ect, she urged her researcher collaborators to continue it [Cobb et al., 1995]).As Hauser (1992) points out, teachers may need training before they can teach students how to hold fruitful discus­sions. In particular, they need to be skilled in effective classroom communication skills in order to enable students to think critically and speak confidently. Hauser’s sug­gestions for fostering discussion in the classroom include:(a) Use of restatements of what the student has said;(b) description of teacher interest, conviction, and so on;(c) request for elaboration; (d) encouragement of questions; and (e) use of wait time (Hauser, 1987; see also Jegede & Olajide, 1995; Wilkerson, Hafler, & Liu, 1991).Self-evaluation of participant behavior, personal reports of communication apprehension, post-discussion question­naires, and self-assessments of leadership abilities have all been found to help teachers improve the quality of group discussions (Millar, 1986). Furthermore, several projects point to the importance of providing opportunities forInstruction: An Overview of Research and Reports 235teachers to work with each other on a regular basis around perceived difficulties involved in discussion-based teach­ing in order for them to begin to understand its possibilities (cf. Northfield, 1992).Summary of Research and Reports on Large Group InstructionResearch and reports on large group instruction raise a host of considerations about the student learning that oc­curs in lectures and discussions. In particular, lectures re­quire that students possess well-developed listening and note taking skills. The findings regarding students’ abili­ties to learn from lectures are mixed, however. Some stud­ies suggest that all students benefit from more interactive classes when these are contrasted with lectures. Other studies indicate that high-ability students and girls per­form no differently in some lecture and laboratory or discussion-based classes, and low-ability students and boys benefit more from discussion than from lecture classes.In contrast, research and reports on discussion-based teaching reflect an emphasis on the benefits of discussion for student learning in all subject matter areas rather than on what students need in order to learn from discussions. This literature suggests that discussions provide students with opportunities to build on their background knowledge and experience, rather than needing to have these ad­dressed for them by the teacher. It is argued that in discus­sions, students develop their abilities to comprehend, since the process of needing to pose an argument, present an opinion, and so on, requires them to both consolidate what is known and to link this with existing knowledge in order to generate an argument.Discussions of both the lecture method and the discus­sion method of large group instruction underscore the im­portance of training teachers in the effective use of these formats, as well as the need for students to develop their skills in learning from lectures and discussions. The in­structional conversation or feedback lecture provides a bridge to a more interactive classroom for teachers and stu­dents who have not had a lot of experience working with discussion.CommentWhat does this overview contribute to our thinking about in­structional formats depicted in the two Jurassic Period case formats? On the one hand, the case formats described for teaching about what makes the Jurassic Period the Jurassic Period offer specific examples of what the teacher might do in a lecture or an interactive class. Both of the case for­mats meet criteria for effective practice laid out in theoverviews of each literature. They reflect the suggestions that teachers should build on student knowledge, include breaks in the lecture/discussion, use post-lecture/ discussion work to help students consolidate their under­standing of materials covered, have as a product an outline that students generate, or notes that summarize points made during the class.On the other hand, since the specific strengths and needs of a group of students are not specified, the case for­mats are simply descriptions of intention. They do not tell us how the instruction will be carried out. (In fact, given the dynamic nature of practice in which teachers are reevaluating and adjusting instruction in response to stu­dents, it is useful to recognize that no case could be more than a snapshot of classroom functioning.)With respect to the lecture format, for example, we do not know anything about how the lectures will be con­ducted, nor do we know what types of lectures they will be. We do not know, for example, how the original source materials will be used in conjunction with the lecture, to what extent student self-questions will be encouraged, and whether students will be helped to develop the skills neces­sary for the effective listening and note taking so essential to learning in a lecture class. Furthermore, we do not know anything about the students and what their abilities are— or, for that matter, their familiarity with the skills and lan­guage necessary for successfully considering issues of period and paleontology. Thus, it is difficult to assume that a lecture format is generally appropriate for the learner. The lecture assumes a high level of self-regulation and prior knowledge, one not characteristic of most learners, especially younger students (see Schunk & Zimmerman, 1994).We know a little more with respect to the interactive format. It is clear that a wide range of tasks for student learning is planned, and that the teacher will use informa­tion from students’ work in these activities (i.e., brain­storming) to inform his or her sense of what they are ready to engage next in terms of their developing skills and discourse-knowledge of history. We really do not know, however, how the interactive tasks proposed will be imple­mented (i.e.. Will all of the contributions to the brainstorm be accepted without comment or ad hoc lecture? Will the teacher be attentive to which students in the class are better able to develop their ideas in a small group, at least,at the outset of the term?).Given that we do not have information about the makeup and abilities of the members of the class, the interactive format appears to be a more optimal starting point for stu­dent learning generally. Interactive methods, by definition.236 Developmental Psychology and Instruction: Issues From and For Practiceencourage and build on students’ responses to content, whereas it is not a given that lecturers will be attentive to students’ prior knowledge and needs as learners.What does the topic of large group instruction contribute more generally to how we think about student learning and its implications for instruction? Based on this overview, it appears that student access or connections to material to be covered can be facilitated in a wide variety of ways. It is also clear that such connections may need to be made ex­plicit for students, depending on their abilities.While there is literature that suggests that lectures can be adjusted to enhance the quality of student comprehen­sion, there is little information that demonstrates the im­portance of lectures in enhancing student comprehension. In fact, based on the literature overviewed, it appears that if a teacher’s goal is for all students to get beyond mere un­derstanding of the material being covered, it is preferable to use discussion-based instruction, that is, discussions that have an open format to which students can readily con­tribute, not a recitation-type discussion. The literature pre­sented here further suggests that more open-ended discussion is important for enabling students to consider al­ternative perspectives on a topic and benefits those with less background in a subject area.Finally, the research and reports on large group instruc­tion seem to reveal mixed findings on the topic of the prod­uct (achievement or outcome) of learning. In general, however, students appear to be more likely to consolidate their understanding of new information in discussions than they are in lectures. (This finding may be all the more pow­erful, given that comparisons of learning in lecture- and discussion-based classes typically employ standardized in­dices that favor lecture-based instruction.)What might we still want to know about large group in­struction based on developmental theory and research? The literature reviewed here covers students of different ages, in different kinds of educational settings, learning about different kinds of subjects, potentially engaging in differ­ent kinds of lectures and discussions, and presented with very different measures of outcome, since these are often specific to the subject matter and the class in which the student is being taught. Furthermore, the type of lecture is never specified in studies of lecturing, and the teacher s particular role in the discussion is almost never specified in studies of discussions.To some extent, the particular organization of this re­view exacerbates the problem of drawing conclusions rele­vant to student learning, since it is organized by issue (i.e., the effects of lectures on student learning), rather than by age, domain, or expertise. Were there a specificconsideration of age, domain, or expertise in the litera­ture, however, they would have been acknowledged. In­stead, it appears that this literature is rich in a wide range of different and preliminary contributions to an under­standing of large group instruction.Current findings from this literature provide the basis of studies that still need to be conducted. As such, they also provide the basis of informed practice wherein what is known is taken as a basis for experimentation.Researchers and teachers may wish to experiment with different types of lecture and discussion formats for differ­ent organizations of student age, familiarity with material to be taught, and class size (15 students, 35 students, 150 students, etc.). The gross differences in the ages of the sample of students typically studied in lectures (high school and post-secondary school) and discussions (ele­mentary and high school) raise some questions for immedi­ate consideration. It is surprising, for example, that there is no literature on lecturing in elementary schools. Elemen­tary teachers spend a good deal of time giving directions and information to their students, so it seems reasonable that systematic consideration of the impact, optimal orga­nization, and timing of what might be called “short lec­tures” on student learning could usefully be undertaken.Furthermore, while the literature reviewed emphasizes the importance of teacher attention to prior knowledge in student learning and the importance of such links to mate­rial to be taught, research on student misconceptions in sci­ence and mathematics, for example, further suggests that students may well need opportunities to confront and re­think their implicit understandings of different subject areas (cf. Gelman, 1994). Familiarity with dinosaurs or the Jurassic Period, for example, is in no way a guarantee of the accuracy of the students’ knowledge or assumptions. In working with students, it is important to explore the base of student knowledge and the ways in which this knowledge may reflect faulty logic (cf. Ginsburg, 1982).Based on our current understanding of how students learn, it also appears that it is particularly important that students develop the metacognitive tools (including strate­gies) necessary to identify for themselves the problem under consideration (such as, how the paleontologist con­firms findings or knows that a fact is a fact). Students need to recognize how problems relate to their prior understand­ing, and begin the process of exploring and evaluating ap­proaches for solving problems (cf. Polya, 1945; Scholnick & Freedman, 1987; Sternberg, 1985). This being the case, it would be useful to know whether it would be more effec­tive to use lectures or discussion or some combination of these two methods in order to enable students to identifyInstruction: An Overview of Research and Reports 237the problem(s) on which they are to work, consider alterna­tive perspectives, and so on. It would be useful to know whether the same approaches are most effective when the information to be learned is largely novel (i.e., what makes the Jurassic Period a period), rather than being based in some more familiar subject area. It would also be useful to know whether the same approaches are most effective when a student is easily able to generate his or her own questions. Finally, it would be useful to consider within- student variation systematically as a function of student access to tasks.Although the literature on discussion specifies the im­portance of more open-ended formats for students to ex­plore ideas, few studies of lectures and discussions specify the type of lecture or discussion being studied, let alone the way in which information from one lecture or discussion to the next is sequenced so that such ideas can be fully explored. Sequenced, open-ended tasks have been found to provide a range of opportunities or entry points for engaging information (cf. Goldman et al., 1994; Kroll & Black, 1993). They enable students both to consolidate what they know and to begin to explore other ways to un­derstand the topic or concepts with which they are work­ing. In fact, they appear to be a useful default format for instruction, especially where student access to a task may be a problem.Finally, although the nature of the teacher-student rela­tionship is clearly perceived to be important for effective lectures and discussions, the nature of the exchange that takes place in such relationships, the shifts of power that need to occur in order for a student to gradually assume more responsibility for learning, how much of a scaffold needs to be provided, and so on, are largely uncharted in­formation. Based on the data that do exist, it seems reason­able that the teacher-student relationship, at minimum, needs to be recognized as reciprocal by both the teacher and the student. The process of learning to problem solve involves a relationship that is emergent. The two parties ad­just their responses in direct relation to each other, even when they are largely Unaware that this is the case (Ren- ninger & Winegar, 1985; see also Mehan, Hertweck, Combs, & Flynn, 1982). From this perspective, it is not re­ally tenable to undertake research or practice based on an assumption that either the lecture or the interactive format is teacher-directed or that learning is the sole responsibil­ity of the student(s). As Alvermann et al. (1990) point out, however, instruction and learning are not always under­stood as involving a joint focus on problem posing and problem solving. The teachers they studied understood themselves to be responsible for student learning.There is a distihction to be drawn between learning to do what the teacher says and developing a knowledge of problem posing and problem solving (Wood, 1995). From a developmental perspective, students’ (and teachers’) ques­tions and connections are central to the process of learning. They reflect the differences in strengths and needs that necessitate the adjustment of classroom instruction.The next section of this review addresses the topic of questioning.QuestioningOverview of Research and ReportsRecent research and reports on questioning.'^ focus on questioning as a vehicle for promoting student learning, de­spite Graesser and Person’s (1994) observation that they largely reflect idealized goals for classroom learning. It should be acknowledged that even though teachers may ask a lot of questions in their classes, often only about 20% of these require them to make connections between what they know and new information; others afe factual or proce­dural in nature (Gall, 1970; Hare & Pulliam, 1980). The presumed reasons for this include the facts that: (a) cur­riculum generally is more fact-oriented than thought-ori­ented, (b) teachers think it is necessary to know facts before progressing to more complex aspects of content and the questions that inform these,'\"* and (c) teachers lack skills or resources to articulate higher order questions in the content areas themselves (Gall, 1970).'^Literature was searched under the following headings: Ques­tioning, Questioning Techniques, Inquiry, Question-Answer Reciprocity, Reciprocal Teaching.Sample: Research and reports on the topic of questioning in­clude studies focused on students ranging in age from kinder­garten through college, with most attention paid to elementary and high school settings. The research examines both typical and atypical populations, including learning disabled, hearing impaired, gifted, low- and high-ability students, English as a Second Language students, and poverty-stricken students. Few studies examine either the average student or differences in questioning as a function of gender or culture.Content areas of focus: Research and reports that discuss questioning tend to focus on the disciplines of English, mathe­matics, and social studies; few to no studies address questioning in science or foreign language classrooms.'*800 Papert (1993) for a discussion of concrete and abstract ways of knowing. Since this issue relates to the content of instruction, it is not discussed further in this chapter.238 Developmental Psychology and Instruction: Issues From and For PracticeFurthermore, students almost never ask questions in classes and when they do, the questions are largely of a pro­cedural nature. In fact, between kindergarten and late ele­mentary school, the proportion of procedural questions triples, while the proportion of curiosity questions drops by half (Lindfors, 1991; see also Good et al., 1987). Interviews with students suggest that these behaviors reflect their un­derstanding that school asks them to do what is assigned (Lindfors, 1991). As Good et al. (1987) point out, the low- achieving student in particular is eventually silenced by a system where asking questions indicates that “you don’t know” (see also Good, 1981; Morine-Dershimer, 1985).In short, while there are those who do concern them­selves with questioning as a reflection of problem solving, this kind of questioning does not reflect common practice in classrooms (van der Meij, 1994; see also Stigler et al., 1996, for cross-cultural considerations). It also should be acknowledged, however, that there are many classrooms in which teachers do employ questioning effectively (cf. in large groups: Ball, 1993; Cobb, Wood, & Yackel, 1993, Hatano & Inagaki, 1991; Lamport, 1986; Lindfors, 1991; in small groups: Copple et al., 1984; Tharp & Gallimore, 1988).Where the goal of learning is problem posing and prob­lem solving, research and practice addresses students questions, question generation, and/or what have been called cognitive strategies or procedures for engaging less- structured tasks where the engagement is contingent on the student having generated a question. The types of questions that are considered to promote student learning are those that involve students in seriously considering the informa­tion with which they are working. It is presumed that whether students understand information from lectures or interactive classes is contingent on how they have been able to engage that information. Being able to consider discrep­ancies between material being learned and prior under­standing of that information and to use the recognition of a gap between the two to ask a question is an indication of both comprehension and an ability to figure out what still needs to be understood—what is called comprehension monitoring. As Mayer and Wittrock (1996) suggest, the problem solver is one who “manage[s] the way in which prior knowledge is used to solve a new problem (p. 50).A problem-solving focus in questioning at the most basic level involves (a) the use of authentic questions (questions for which you do not already have an answer); (b) genuine encouragement of student input; (c) incorporation of previ­ous classroom contributions into questioning; (d) using re­sponses to questions to validate the way in which thestudents are contributing to the course of the discussion; (e) posing questions that elicit nonroutine generalizations, analyses, or speculations; and (f) encouraging questions that reflect thought (Nystrand & Gamoran, 1988). This ap­proach to questioning reflects the notion that the teacher needs to facilitate students’ developing abilities to ask or recognize questions, and that such facilitation requires shifting the power from the teacher as question asker to student as problem solver.Van der Meij (1994) distinguishes between questions designed to solve problems and questions used to learn how to do something. Citing his own work and that of Siegler (1977) as examples of questioning to solve abstract prob­lems, he points out that older students more often seek to refine their understanding by identifying constraints in the situation than do younger students, and questioning is often more strategic at the outset of a problem since initial questions eliminate more options than do later questions. Research on questioning that involves learning to do some­thing indicates, instead, an interaction between prior knowledge and questioning. Across several task contexts, those with more knowledge have been found to ask more higher order questions—questions that have to do with the organization of the task and its goals (cf. Flammer, Grob, Leuthardt, & Luthi, 1982a, 1982b; Scardamalia & Beri- eter, 1992). Van der Meij (1994) further observes that it would be worth examining whether the types of questions at various stages of learning differ in a predictable way— information that has not yet been compiled.Ciancido and Quirk (1993) report that students as young as those in kindergarten and first grade were quite capable of learning how to respond critically to literature, which suggests that questioning and critical thinking can be taught to younger as well as older students. These findings also indicate that skillful use of questions and guidance by the teacher helps to facilitate critical thinking. Similarly, Feagans (1994) reports that second graders were able to use probes to orally evaluate their own writing and, following modeling by the teacher, were able to write evaluations. The probes appear to have provided a scaffold for students not only to evaluate their own writing, but to enhance and transfer the understanding they developed to other types of writing.It appears that with instructional support, even very young students can begin to work with questions related to their understanding of concepts and strategy use, although they appear to need instruction to do so. Perry, Vander- stoep, and Yu (1993) found, for example, that Asian teach­ers asked first graders significantly more addition andInstruction: An Overview of Research and Reports 239subtraction questions that required them to draw on what they knew and to use strategies in order to accomplish these tasks than did U.S. teachers.The issue of instructional support is critical (cf. Press- ley, Johnson, Symons, McGoldrick, & Kurita, 1989). As van der Meij (1993) reports, study of the types of questions fifth- and sixth-grade students ask when reading a text sug­gests that without instructional support, many students rely on a repertoire of generic questions that can easily be found in the text, rather than generating higher order ques­tions. Similarly, findings from Newman and Schwager (1995) suggest the importance of organizing instruction so that the students understand that the emphasis is on student learning. They found that while sixth graders are generally more likely than third graders to request process-related hints and less likely to simply ask for an answer, when given learning goals, both third and sixth graders were more likely to have adaptive patterns of questioning in their help seeking than were students given performance goals.Instructional support for questioning can also extend beyond the particulars of the actual questions posed to in­clude instructional formats that involve teachers in work­ing explicitly with students on their abilities to question. Examples of such direct instruction include reciprocal teaching, self-questioning, and elaborative interrogation. Reciprocal teaching (cf. Palincsar & Brown, 1984; see Rosenshine & Meister, 1994 for a review) is frequently cited as an effective method for facilitating student ques­tioning. In reciprocal teaching, the teacher initially models the strategies of question generation, summarizing, clarifi­cation, and prediction—strategies that good readers prac­tice spontaneously—and through sequenced instruction gradually encourages the students to assume the role of teacher. Although this kind of structured dialogue was originally developed to work with poor readers (cf. Palinc­sar & Klenk, 1991), it has been found to benefit the com­prehension of all types of students (cf. Frances & Eckart, 1992) in subject areas as varied as reading, math, and sci­ence (cf. Brown & Campione, 1994; Brown, Campione, Reeve, Ferrara, & Palincsar, 1991). In fact, Kelly, Moore, and Tuck (1994) report both that gains among grade four students on a reciprocal reading task were maintained at an eight-week follow-up and that the students were able to gen­eralize their understanding across different reading genres.Instruction in self-questioning is another method for fa­cilitating student questioning. Self-questioning involves students in posing questions during or after lectures or the reading of text. The process of self-questioning providesstudents with feedback that not only motivates them to ex­amine the topics being covered, but leads them to do so with reflection (see review by Wong, 1985). Encouraging students to use self-questioning has been found to be more effective than other techniques, such as summarizing, pre­sumably because it involves students in considering what they do and do not know about the question posed. As Wong (1985) points out, this process requires them to be actively involved in seeking answers. It also gives them in­creased responsibility for their learning. Methods that fa­cilitate self-questioning, for example, include assignments to write questions that a particular text does not answer or even raise, formulation of hypotheses and generation of arguments that support and refute them, or deletion of crit­ical information during a lecture or discussion that piques students’ need to ask questions (Graesser, 1992). Fenwick and McMillan (1992) further suggest the usefulness of in­structors’ modeling their own use of self-questions.Elaborative interrogation is another strategy that in­volves students in further explaining what they have read by answering “why” questions. In this type of self­generated elaboration, students are explicitly involved in reconstructing their understanding of information they are reading in terms of what they know. Compared to condi­tions in which students read and studied the same para­graphs, students who took facts from a text and made them into “why” questions had better recall than those who read the text under normal conditions. In fact, even when the students did not answer the why questions, they were still more likely to recall the text than were students who had not generated questions (Pressley et al., 1992).Pressley et al. (1989), however, caution that when cog­nitive strategy instruction is only introduced briefly or mentioned to students, there are few gains in their compre­hension. When, on the other hand, instruction for self­questioning is part of ongoing instruction, student comprehension is significantly enhanced (cf. Davey & McBride, 1986).An alternative to the direct teaching of cognitive strate­gies or self-questions is to provide an environment for stu­dents that builds on their questions, within a context that provides the structure necessary to guide them to substan­tial inquiry. In the Computer Supported Intentional Learn­ing Environments (CSILE) project, for example, the computer is used as a vehicle for conununicating among students as they work to answer questions, follow up on questions posed previously, and so on (Bereiter & Scar- damalia, 1992). CSILE has been used in a variety of sub­ject matter areas (social studies, literature, mathematics.240 Developmental Psychology and Instruction: Issues From and For Practicegeography, etc.) and with simple as well as complex as­signments.Students’ use of CSILE indicates that they are capable of generating reasoned inquiry and can talk about the strategies that they are using. Scardamalia et al. (1994) re­port that in grades 1 through 3, students working with CSILE are primarily absorbed in their own work or work with a partner, but can take an interest in what the rest of the class is doing with respect to a project. On the other hand, only one of these teachers reported that a class was able to consider problems of understanding, such as appre­ciating that claims were claims, rather than immutable facts. By grades 4 through 6, however, students evidence a greater focus on problems of understanding. Scardamalia et al. also note the importance of teacher encouragement in successful collaborative knowledge building at this age. For both grade levels, the success of this project was dependent on having time for reflection and refinement of work, op­portunities for public and private displays of work in prog­ress, and access to and exchange of texts, resources, and so on (Scardamalia & Bereiter, 1992; see also project descriptions such as Cobb & Bauersfeld, 1995; Cognition and Technology Group at Vanderbilt, 1991; Brown & Campione, 1994).Emphasis on questioning that requires student explana­tion characterizes the environment that Japanese teachers more or less uniformly present for their students (Steven­son & Stigler, 1992). Stigler et al. (1996), for example, re­port that in the Japanese lessons they studied, the most frequent types of teacher questions were how and why questions (i.e., “How did you find the area of a triangle? or Why is the area here 177”) (p. 166). The next most frequent type of question involved checking the status of explana­tion with the others in the class—asking if there were any other explanations to be considered.’^ Such questioning stands in contrast to the lessons of teachers from the United States, whose most frequent type of questions ask students to give short-answer responses that name or label the kind of triangle, specify the length of a side, and so on. The second most frequent question asked students for the answer to a specific calculation. Not surprisingly, Japanese‘5 Stigler et al. (1996) point out, however, that the teaching ob­served in the Japanese elementary school is quite different than that in the secondary school where the emphasis is on rote mem­orization. They suggest that the Japanese elementary classrooms are organized to teach students to think. By high school, the in­ference might be that students are ready to acquire the content on which such skills might be used.students were found to be more likely to talk and explain themselves than were students in the United States.Interestingly, Japanese teachers have a wealth of infor­mation available about the methods students will develop themselves in order to solve problems. As Stigler et al. (1996) point out, the Japanese teacher does not need to gen­erate such responses by him- or herself. The entry-level teacher has a set of resources that specifies the range of possible solution types, in turn, underscoring the impor­tance of explanation for the process of “doing math” and the impossibility of assuming that students’ answers might be limited to whether they were able to get the answer. With such resources it is possible to identify a key question on which to focus a lesson and a sense of the kind of expla­nation with which students new to a concept will be able to work (Kawanaka & Stigler, 1997), something that is not available to most teachers in the United States (with the ex­ception of those working with projects in which the range of possible student responses have been mapped, i.e.. Cog­nitively Guided Instruction [Fennema et al., 1989]).A further question, however, needs to be asked about what exactly is involved in “training” students to question. It appears that it is only possible to specify what kinds of accomplishments might be set as the goals for learning to question, rather than a specific type or sequence of ques­tions that will be effective in all settings. For example, Au and Jordon (1981) reported that questioning strategies used successfully by teachers of White middle-class stu­dents failed with Hawaiian students because these students had different expectations for teacher behavior. As a re­sponse, Au and Jordon developed the E-T-R program, which built on students’ experience (E), the text (T), and relationships between experience and text (R) (see also Au, 1979, 1981).Interestingly enough, Tharp (1994) reports that when the E-T-R program developed to improve the reading skills of the Hawaiian students was implemented in Navajo reser­vation schools, it too needed to be adjusted. In the Hawai­ian school, teachers introduced the story by encouraging students to talk about experiences they had had that were similar to those described in the story; following this, the teacher read the text and returned to experience questions to build additional background. Finally, the teacher-guided student processing of the text so that this occurred at vari­ous levels of comprehension, leading the students to relate their experiences to new ideas from the texts. In the Navajo setting, because the students objected to being asked ques­tions during the reading of the story, the teachers first needed to ask all of the experiential questions, then read the text with the class, answer questions about the text, andInstruction: An Overview of Research and Reports 241finally relate the texts back to their personal experiences. The skills on which they were working with the Navajo stu­dents were the same as those on which the Hawaiian chil­dren had worked, but the sequencing of the tasks had to be adjusted.In their review of question generation, Rosenshine et al. (1996) found it “difficult to derive any prescriptions on how to develop effective procedural prompts” [scaffolds provided for students in cognitive strategies instruction] (p. 198). They were able to determine that the most suc­cessful prompts were easy to use and did not demand strong cognitive skills. The three most effective prompts included signal words (i.e., who, what), generic question stems (another example is . . .) or generic questions, and categories of story grammar (i.e., setting, character).Other elements of instruction that were used (although not all at once) to facilitate student ability to generate questions included providing prompts specific to the strat­egy being taught, offering models of appropriate responses, anticipating students’ difficulties, adjusting the difficulty of the material, providing cue cards, guiding student prac­tice, giving feedback, instructing students in the use of a checklist, and assessing student mastery (Rosenshine et al., 1996).The notion that there are principles guiding the way in which questioning is undertaken, but that there are not pro­cedures that necessarily have to be implemented in the same way in order to carry out questioning, characterizes Sigel and Kelley’s (1988) discussion of questioning strate­gies (see also discussion of “first principles” in Brown & Campione, 1994). They suggest specifically that working with students to engage a topic involves a spirallike se­quence: focus, explore, restructure, (re)focus, and so on.For example, if students are just about to begin work on a task (focus), Sigel and Kelley suggest using three types of questions; an open-ended question, a question that poses a problem, or a question that introduces some kind of conflict with prior information. They specify what questioning might look like at the point of accessing the problem/task and offer examples of how it might play out, but their scheme is actually predicated on the notion that the teacher needs to determine student readiness for particular ques­tions. The initial task of the teacher is to determine the ex­periential, cognitive, and emotional status of the learners in relation to the knowledge to be learned or goal to be ac­complished. This information represents the psychological distance between the readiness of the students for the task and the goal to be accomplished. The actual distancing in which the teacher engages is determined by the teacher, based on this information. Sigel and Kelley further notethat it is not the first question and its answer that provide an indicator of the students’ readiness and understanding; rather, it is the students’ ability to follow through with a second question that is the critical indicator of engagement or questioning and readiness to move on to a deeper level of understanding.Where teachers such as those in Japan identify their goals in teaching to work with children on problem posing and problem solving, they can be likened to researchers (Stigler et al., 1996). Kawanaka and Stigler (1997) point out that Japanese teachers’ lesson plans are quite detailed and are focused on what students need to be thinking. For each lesson, they have identified at least one question that is intended to focus and further develop the students’ thinking. They found, in contrast, that teachers in the United States are more likely to plan what they will do in a lesson and to use questions as a check on students’ compre­hension (Kawanaka & Stigler, 1997).Without the resources that mapped information about students’ difficulties and strategies could provide, many teachers are spontaneous in their questioning, meaning that their questions are poorly phrased and generally do not lead to answers that yield new questions (Gall, 1984). Con­sistent with findings that suggest the need to facilitate and provide instruction to scaffold students’ abilities to ques­tion, it appears that simply providing teachers with infor­mation about questioning is not sufficient to enable them to change their practice and work with their students on de­veloping questioning skills (Graesser, 1992). Information about cognitive strategies (Duffy, 1993) and/or reform classroom practice (Wood, 1995) does not appear to be a substitute for the opportunity to work with these con­cepts—being in the position to question them (and others). Peer discussant feedback (Wilen & Campbell, 1992) that builds on teachers’ present practice and presents them with links between it and findings from research on reciprocal teaching, and opportunities for collaboration (Palincsar & Klenk, 1991) are methods that have been found to foster teachers’ comprehension and awareness of the possibilities for developing their own skills and using questioning in their work with students.Summary of Research and Reports on QuestioningQuestioning forms the basis of research and practice con­cerned with student learning where learning is understood to involve problem posing and problem solving. It is de­scribed as both a reflection of and a contributor to student learning. Research and reports on questioning focus on teacher behaviors that can be used to elicit student ques­tioning. In their classrooms, teachers can ask students for242 Developmental Psychology and Instruction: Issues From and For Practiceexplanations, provide time for students to think about ques­tions, ask open-ended questions, pose problems, have con­versations, elaborate on their answers, and so on.Furthermore, teachers can instruct students in cognitive strategies in order to foster questioning, developing student comprehension, and abilities to monitor their own compre­hension, including question posing. Reciprocal teaching, self-questions, use of prompts, class-based problem solv­ing, and distancing strategies are reviewed as methods of working with students on questioning.Finally, parallels between methods for working with students and teachers to understand the potential of includ­ing questioning in classroom instruction are identified.CommentWhat does this overview contribute to our thinking about instructional formats depicted in the two Jurassic Period case formats? Both case formats described for teaching about what makes the Jurassic Period the Jurassic Period open with questions in order to anchor the lesson in the stu­dents’ knowledge base and as a way for the teacher to fig­ure out what the students do and do not understand about the topic. Using the students’ current knowledge and ad­justing the level of explanation in light of what they know increases the likelihood that the students will connect to and engage in the material being covered in the lecture. It would also have been possible to specify modeling of self­questioning, instruction in cognitive strategies, or prompts in this lecture format, but given the use of the brainstorm, this was not necessary. The brainstorm was chosen be­cause, in this case, it was the first day of the class, when a brainstorm would provide an opportunity to gather ideas and enable everyone to have a voice.It is even more clear in the interactive format that stu­dents are initially provided with questions to address, and that brainstorming not only triggers their ideas, but pro­vides the basis of their discussion. The students’ answers are expected to consolidate what they already know and what their questions may be. This information provides them with the basis for their subsequent efforts to figure out what makes the Jurassic Period the Jurassic Period.It is apparent that the interactive format provides multi­ple opportunities for students to address their own and others’ questions with peers and/or expert others. Further­more, the questioning in which the class as a whole is en­gaged can be expected to range from simple open-ended responses to more focused, text-based considerations. Writing their own chapter books provides a format for stu­dents to consolidate their individual understandings of the investigations begun in the classroom in the discussionformat. In fact, the organization of the interactive format enables students to turn to the class as a whole or to others in the class for confirmation and elaboration of ideas with which they are working and for strategies for doing the work as these are needed. They also have Ask Dr. Dino, the Web, and classroom materials as resources.What does the topic of questioning contribute more gen­erally to how we think about student learning and its impli­cations for instruction? Students’ access or connections to material can be facilitated by questioning. Questions can be the basis of instruction and can enable students to connect their own questions to the material being covered, and instruction in use of cognitive strategies can provide students with a basis for learning how to make such connections.The example of the E-T-R reading program and its nec­essary adjustment further suggests that while the concept being taught through the use of questioning may not ehange, the actual process of teacher questioning may need to be thought about as always requiring adjustment in re­sponse to the strengths and needs of students. Thus, the process of posing a question appears to require that the stu­dent be able to identify the problem a task poses (cf. Gall, 1984; Steinberg, 1985), that the student has “focused” on the task and the questions inherent in it, and that the stu­dent be ready to “explore,” “restructure,” and so on (to bor­row Sigel & Kelley’s, 1988, terminology).Instructing students in such cognitive strategies as re­ciprocal teaching and self-questioning provides them with the tools they need to identify the problem under discussion and then begin the process of working through it more closely. Classroom-based problem solving such as that de­scribed in the CSILE project accomplishes similar ends. In fact, since the problems come from the students, the strug­gle to get them to focus on a problem is eliminated. It could also be argued that identifying a problem and generating a problem are two very different tasks, and as such pose different and complementary challenges from which all students can benefit.What might we still want to know about questioning based on developmental theory and research? The work on questioning focuses on ways in which teachers can build opportunities for students to question—and to learn to question—into their lectures and discussions. The litera­ture reviewed here covers students who range in age, are in different kinds of educational settings, and are learning about different kinds of subjects. Some of them are being presented with different types of experienees to enable them to pose questions; presumably, others are in class­rooms where they are not encouraged to ask any questions.Instruction: An Overview of Research and Reports 243We do not learn much from this literature about stu­dents’ natural inclinations to question, or whether there is any difference in the effectiveness of cognitive strategy in­struction as a function of student age, gender, cultural inter- or independence, interest, school culture, and so on. We also do not learn whether students’ questions are “shut down” by particular instructional techniques and what it takes to change such a situation if this is the case.It appears that students in early elementary school are able to seriously engage questioning and cognitive strategy instruction. We also know that they can contribute to the development of the collective knowledge that characterizes class-based problem solving in CSILE. Interestingly, Scar- damalia et al. (1994) report that only one class of students in grades 1 through 3 was able to work on addressing claims as claims rather than as immutable facts. Given that students who worked with the interactive case format on the Jurassic Period described were second graders and were seriously engaged in the verification of facts as facts—problems of understanding—it seems likely that these two classes are not anomalies, but that there may be other developmental considerations in addition to age that could be considered.One explanation for differences among classes in the level of their work with questioning may have to do with how well matched this kind of problem for understanding is to the curriculum in general (cf. Farnham-Diggory, 1994), the culture of the school (cf. Good et al., 1990), and the personal culture of the students. It seems reasonable to suggest that what may appear to be age-based developmen­tal differences in such settings may actually be mediated by teacher facilitation and work with students to under­stand what they are doing and why they are doing it, through processing with them the experience of their prob­lem posing.The importance of instructional support, especially for tasks where the students need to identify (cf. Sternberg, 1985) rather than generate the problem, is clear. What is less clear is the kind of consideration given in cognitive strategy instruction to identifying student difficulties prior to instruction. How is a student’s conceptual understanding developed through questioning? Is there a more opportune time to work with and model reciprocal teaching, learning to self-question, and so on, in terms of age, experience with particular instructional formats, or subject area fa­miliarity? Do students learn to question, after much effort, because of the way that they are taught? Is the appropriate­ness of the questions posed in, say, the eighth grade, depen­dent on whether a student is led to ask questions, develop ideas and a foundation for understanding, and work withthese ideas in earlier schooling? What is the difference in learning if one learns in a sequence that moves from fact to synthesis, rather than learning facts through efforts to syn­thesize information? What are the implications of develop­ments in our understanding about misconception for thinking about students’ (and teachers’) questions?When students do have questions and are encouraged to ask them, there are other questions to be addressed about how to build on students’ questions and how to help them become even more resourceful as learners. There are also questions to be asked about the form of questioning that works for students, at what ages, in what kinds of settings, and perhaps with which kinds of conceptions/misconcep­tions these are most appropriate. Interestingly, descrip­tions of instructional practice that included questioning in this overview were also descriptions of classroom group­ing. In group work, students typically work together any­where between three minutes to a week or two in order to accomplish the goals of a prescribed task. One benefit of group work is that it enables students to both ask questions of and seek solutions from their peers, in addition to having question asking modeled for them by their peers (Webb, 1989). Another benefit is that it permits students to have different kinds of access to—make different kinds of eon- nections with—the tasks they are assigned.The overview that follows focuses on grouping in the classroom, including the use of group work.GroupingOverview of Research and ReportsIn the ERIC database, research and reports on grouping*® encompass a variety of teaching practices. Although the** Literature was searched under the following headers; Group­ing for Instructional Purposes, Mixed-Age Groups, Vertical Classroom, Vertical Grouping, Non-Graded Instructional Group­ing, Multi-Graded Classes, Heterogeneous Grouping, Homoge­neous Grouping, Cross-Age Teaching, Peer Tutoring, Peer Teaching.Sample: Research and reports on grouping address both the selection of students for particular classes (i.e., ability grouping or tracking) and instruction in which students are grouped for peer learning or teaching and small group instruction. Most of the research on grouping focuses on elementary students, and its predominant focus is gifted students. A few studies have evalu­ated the effects of grouping on minority students, special educa­tion students, students with developmental disahilities, or at-risk students. A few other studies have addressed grouping of sec­ondary students or grouping in day-care programs. Only a few244 Developmental Psychology and Instruction; Issues From and For Practiceprimary foci of these studies and reports are (a) the effects of grouping on students’ learning and (b) the training nec­essary for teachers to use grouping practices in instruction effectively, a competing subtext reflects the strong feelings (pro and con) of these researchers and educators about grouping. For the purposes of this review, this subtext is ac­knowledged but not taken as a focus.Grouping, as it is used here, refers to both assignment of students to a class, as well as to the use of flexible grouping within classes. Because the decision to assign students to group work within classes is often informed by what is un­derstood about assignment of students to classes (ability grouping, mixed age grouping, and so on), this overview addresses both assignment of students to classes as well as the use of flexible grouping or what is also simply labeled small group or group work within classes.Effects of Grouping on Student Learning. Studies of the effects of mixed-age (vertical or nongraded instruc­tion) and ability groupings on student learning have yielded mixed results. In general, the research reveals that mixed- age instruction (classes with students who, in a more tradi­tional setting, would be assigned to different grades) has little effect on student performance when compared to other, more traditional, practices. If there is a difference, it is usually in favor of multi-age classrooms. Jensen and Green (1993) found that children in multi-age groupings performed as well academically as children in single-age groupings (SAGs) and also developed better self-concepts and school attitudes than children in SAGs. Miller’s (1990, 1991a, 1991b) reviews affirm such conclusions (see also Pratt, 1986). Furthermore, as Hartup (1996) reports, chil­dren and adolescents choose friends who are similar in de­velopment, not age. Thus, in multi-age classes, it might be expected that children would more readily find friends, and that such friendship will provide a supportive base from which students can be challenged academically.''' In fact.studies have considered either the effects of grouping on average students or the role of gender as a factor in grouping.Content areas of focus: Studies and reports on grouping tend to be focused on reading, language arts, and mathematics classes. Few studies examine grouping in laboratory or science classes, foreign language classes, or social studies classes. •’Azmitia (1996) points out, however, that in adolescence, friends can sustain and repair collaborations, but there is a de­cline in the incidence of negotiation among friends, suggesting that the synergy that might be expected to be provided by friends to get students through a difficult task is not necessarily energy that will get them to push each other’s understanding in a group situation.in his review, Pratt (1986) suggests that the general picture that emerges from the literature is one of increased compe­tition and aggression within SAGs, and increased harmony in mixed-age classrooms.Mixed-aged grouping is considered to be particularly beneficial for elementary students, given their varying rates of development (Evangelou, 1989).'® Katz and Chard (1989) specify that it provides for the development of (a) leadership skills, (b) pro-soeial behaviors, (c) freedom of involvement and play, (d) self-regulation, (e) social participation, (f) models of more complex behaviors, and (g) adjustment of communication abilities. Mixed-ability grouping also requires that students learn to structure their learning time and to choose strategies appropriate to their needs (Veenman, Lem, & Voeten, 1988). Interestingly, Stright and French (1988) report similar patterns of learn­ing success and leadership behavior among nine-year-old and eleven-year-old students when they were paired with children two years younger than themselves. These find­ings provide support for the argument that mixed-age peer groups are an important context for learning and the development of leadership skills. At present, however, as DelForge, DelForge, and DelForge (1992) observe, there is no agreed-upon way to group elementary students in mixed-grade or combination classrooms. Variables used to group students include matched levels of academic ability, mixed levels of academic ability, degree of self-discipline, and social maturity.In contrast to mixed findings regarding particular grouping of students, research on cross-age teaching or tu­toring uniformly suggests that this method of grouping stu­dents affords both tutors and tutees an opportunity to enlarge their understanding of the topic being taught as well as to improve their social skills and attitudes toward school. Cross-age tutoring is essentially another form of mixed-group work in which, most typically, an older, at- risk, or disadvantaged student tutors a younger student— although students who are tutors do not need to be at risk. Trapani (1988) and Trapani and Gettinger (1989) report that providing fourth- to sixth-grade learning-disabled boys with social skills training and cross-age tutoring resulted in improved achievement and ability to work with others. It appears that tutors benefit from cross-age and peer tutoring'®How “mixed” the classroom is may adversely affect the bene­fit, however. Specifically, Sundell (1994) reports that in Swedish schools, differences in students’ ages in mixed ability classes are typically three or more years and sometimes as much as six years. Mixed-age classes more typically include students whose age varies by no more than two years.Instruction: An Overview of Research and Reports 245because in their role as resources for each other, they need to assume responsibility and are put in the position of demonstrating their ability to be the knower. The process of tutoring also requires that they review material, in turn enabling them to further consolidate their understanding of it (Gaustad, 1992).Based on the findings from cross-age tutoring research, it might be expected that the impact of ability grouping on student learning would be related to the degree to which the curriculum is adjusted to provide resources to students and require them to be responsible for the material they are learning. Not surprisingly, it does appear that the more a grouping arrangement serves to adjust the curriculum to students’ abilities, the greater the effect such grouping has on students (Kulik, 1993). Kdlik (1992) reports that sepa­rate classes for gifted students involving enrichment or ac­celerated work involve the greatest amount of curricular adjustment and have the greatest effect on student learning.Findings from study of the consolidation of middle- and upper-track English and social studies classes in a Maine high school indicates, too, that curricular adjustment in heterogeneous classrooms benefits students. Following consolidation, (a) students had high levels of self-esteem, (b) teachers perceived increased self-esteem in the mid­level student, (c) students had a positive perception of the learning environment, (d) staff ability to reorganize the learning environment increased, (e) teachers preferred het­erogeneous groups, (f) students’ motivation increased, (g) students took responsibility for their learning, (h) stu­dents had a positive perception of class activities, (i) teachers diversified and improved their teaching strate­gies, (j) classes became more student-centered and interac­tive, and (k) teachers observed a decrease in the gaps between performance and students’ identified roles as middle- and upper-level students (Foppish et al., 1990).It appears that the process of teachers’ adjusting or tailoring classes for the students they teach benefits all students, whether they are paired as in cross-age tutoring, placed in homogeneous classrooms as gifted students, or assigned to heterogeneous classes. Such findings provide support for a hypothesis that grouping affects students in direct relation to the extent to which teachers adjust cur­riculum to meet student abilities. They also suggest that grouping affects students in relation to the particular vari­ables addressed by the study (cf. Hoover, Sayler, & Feld- husen, 1993). For example, when variables such as socialization and psychological effects on students are considered, it appears that gifted students feel less sure about their self-worth when grouped with other high- ability students (Keller, 1991). This finding, however, is mediated by the specific type of classroom placement forthe gifted learners (Kulik, 1992), and potentially by how instruction is adjusted to these students’ strengths and needs.Several studies suggest alternatives to ability grouping and tracking of students between classes, and advocate ad­justing instruction in the classroom through use of flexible grouping. Flexible grouping refers to grouping of students based on their diverse interests and learning rates. Such grouping can be maintained over time or used for single tasks (cf. Barbour, 1990). Findings from study of the ef­fects of flexible grouping on student learning also are mixed. This, at least to some extent, is presumably due to the range of classroom grouping that is labeled “group work.’’ Good et al. (1990) and Gerleman (1987) distinguish between teachers who teach two or three groups (typically assigned by ability, all of whom receive the same assign­ment) and classrooms in which a more flexible assignment of students and tasks is used. In the former, students are typically instructed in small groups (organized based on ability) and then do seat work as follow-up to this instruc­tion. In the latter, teachers often make use of the small group time as an opportunity for active, hands-on learning, and follow this format with either (a) whole group instruc­tion that permits follow-up discussion of issues raised in the small groups, links between work engaged previously or that will follow, or (b) group collaboration on projects, worksheets, and so on.A meta-analysis of the research on flexible grouping did reveal several consistent findings. These include:'® (a) group work by itself is no guarantee of achievement gains; (b) no one type of grouping is more likely to promote stu­dent achievement than another; (c) large classes of students appear to benefit most from flexible grouping; (d) students in math and science classes, in particular, seem to benefit from flexible grouping; (e) grouping is most effective when it is accompanied by modifications of instructional meth­ods and materials to be taught (in other words, the way in which group work is undertaken built on the strengths and needs of the students, including their prior experience with group work, their need for discrete goals and accountabil­ity, and so on); (f) 3- to 4-person groups of students are an optimal size for group work; and (g) group work is most ef­fective when students are compatible (Lou et al., 1996).One of the most common methods of grouping students in the classroom involves pairing them for group work or peer education. Damon (1984), in his review of the literature.'®This meta-analysis did not include studies of students paired for group work.246 Developmental Psychology and Instruction: Issues From and For Practicehowever, suggests distinguishing between the use of peer tutoring and peer collaboration in classrooms based on the intended task. Specifically, his reading of the literature suggests that it is most effective for students to work to­gether as peer tutors when they need to bolster the under­standing of skills and information in which they are receiving more direct instruction, for example, historical facts, word attack skills, multiplication tables, and so on. When students need to be developing their understanding of concepts related to classwork, however, he suggests that peer collaboration is more appropriate.Peer tutoring classically involves same-age peers work­ing together, where one peer teaches the other a skill or strategy. Peer tutoring can be used as whole-class instruc­tion with everyone taking turns in the roles of tutor and tutee (cf. Gartner & Riessman, 1994) as (a) a supplement to instruction (cf. Lundeberg, 1990) and (b) as specific stu­dent pairing for learning in classes (cf. Kutnick & Thomas, 1990). On the whole, it appears that as in the results re­ported on mixed-age and ability groups, peer tutoring also benefits students’ academic achievement and social devel­opment, enhancing their self-esteem (Gomer, 1992), fos­tering an exchange of ideas among native and non-native English-speaking ninth graders prior to revision of first drafts (Blake, 1992), and leading to more revisions even among learning-disabled students (MacArthur, Schwartz, & Graham, 1991). Paired tutor-tutee groupings were also found to outperform peers in understanding concepts in chemistry (Kutnick & Thomas, 1990).Carter and Jones (1993) report, furthermore, that het­erogeneous pairing of fifth-grade students in science can be mutually beneficial to low-ability students partnered with high-ability students. They found that (a) low-ability student achievement is greater when students are paired with high-ability partners; (b) low-ability students spoke more and exhibited less distracting behaviors when paired with partners of high-ability; (c) high-ability students spoke more, took more turns speaking, and exhibited more helping behaviors when they were paired with low-ability students rather than with other high-ability students; and (d) ability of partner did not affect achievement of high- ability students. Tudge (1989) reports, however, that while low-ability students paired with high-ability students on a mathematical balance-beam task were more likely to en­gage the demands of the task in a qualitatively different way than would have been possible if they had been work­ing independently, high-ability students in these pairings regressed in their level of thinking. In another experiment, this regression did not occur when students were provided with feedback about their work (Tudge, 1992). In fact.students working individually on the task also performed better with feedback. These findings are interpreted as ev­idence that the type and organization of a task (in this case, grouping and provision of feedback) help to determine the benefits of the grouping experience.Slavin and his colleagues’ discussions of effective group work, in particular, underscore the importance of estab­lishing clear group goals and making individuals account­able to the group (see Slavin, 1983). Methods of grouping students for work can range from having pairs of students constitute a group to having sequenced groupings and re­groupings of students working together. Two of the more complex and commonly employed versions of such group­ing and regrouping are the Jigsaw classroom (Aronson et al., 1978) and the Teams-Games-Tournament (TGT) (Slavin, 1983).^® Both of these forms of group work can2»Brief examples of Aronson et al.’s (1978) Jigsaw classroom and Slavin’s (1983) Teams-Games-Tournament (TGT) follow, set in the context of the case study at the outset of this chapter.The Jigsaw classroom was originally developed to facilitate school integration efforts. As such, its structure permits stu­dents with varying levels of ability to work together and depend on their work together, while developing content area skills and knowledge. There are two parts to the Jigsaw. In the first, stu­dents participate in an information-gathering/demonstration phase. In the second, they are the experts on whatever they did with their group in the first part of the Jigsaw and are responsi­ble for teaching it to the second group of students.For the first part of a Jigsaw (which can take a half an hour, an hour and a half, or a period a day for a week, depending on the nature of the task), the particular content of the assignments and their accompanying instructions can be tailored to the learn­ing needs of the initial group to which students are assigned. Thus, for example, students in groups of 4 to 5 might receive a reading assignment or a set of tasks about some aspect of a bigger question, such as how to explain change or how to describe a pe­riod (for example, as part of the unit on the characteristics of the Jurassic Period). The assignment would or could be tailored to students’ reading level or level of comprehension and would not be duplicated in the assignments given to other groups. One group might focus on fossilization, another on a dig and how to convert observations (such as a bone found lying sideways) into explanations, another might write a play about dinosaurs as care­givers, and so on.If any group in particular needs explicit instruction, they can also receive study questions, sets of instructions, even work­sheets that will make them accountable for doing the assignment for each period they work. Once students complete their task for the first part of the Jigsaw, they move to the second part, where they share their work with one person from each of the other groups. A critical feature of the Jigsaw is that students in theInstruction: An Overview of Research and Reports 247involve students in either cooperative or collaborative group work. Whether the group work is ultimately labeled cooperative or collaborative would depend upon the nature of the task, the goals of the group, and the ability of the group of students to focus on a joint goal.Slavin’s (1983) review of research on cooperative learning indicates that it promotes higher achievement than competitive and individualistic learning structures, promotes healthy ethnic relations, and reduces racial con­flict. It is considered to lessen the need for and reduce the use of tracking and separate enrichment programs for the gifted, and to enable students to maximize their own and each other’s learning (Slavin, 1983, 1990). Findings re­ported by Terwel, Herfs, Mertens, and Perrenet (1994) further indicate that students in heterogeneous mathemat­ics classes taught with cooperative learning techniques achieve more than students taught in traditional ability- grouped classrooms.Webb and Palincsar (1996) point out, however, that there is a distinction to be made between cooperation, where students work together to meet a group goal, and co­operation that evolves into collaboration within the group. Cooperative group work typically involves tasks that serve to build students’ base of facts and discrete skills (Slavin, 1987)—although as the footnoted example of the Jigsaw il­lustrates, cooperative grouping does not have to be limited to work on discrete information. On the other hand, work on classroom-based problem-solving projects (e.g., Bereiter & Scardamalia, 1992; Brown & Campione, 1994; Cobb, Yackel, & Wood, 1995; Cognition and Technology Group at Vanderbilt, in press) might more appropriately be consid-second part of the Jigsaw do not have access to the materials that students in other groups had for the first part. They must depend on the student who is the expert for learning about that specific part of that task.In TGT, the teacher first presents the lesson, typically in a lecture format such as that described in the case study. For the purposes of this example, the topic of the lecture will be charac­teristics of dinosaurs during the Jurassic Period. Following the lecture, teams of 4 to 5 students are organized to represent a cross-section of the class. Students are given two worksheets to fill out—necessitating that they work together—based on infor­mation from the lecture. This team study period also prepares them for the tournament. Students from the teams are each as­signed to a tournament table where their tournament partners are people who are matched to them in ability. The tournament con­sists of a rehearsal of information presented in the lecture and on the worksheet used for team study; it often takes the form of a ditto sheet of numbered questions and a stack of cards with numbers.ered instances of collaborative group work where the focus is on understanding that requires discussion and problem solving. Such projects have been designed to capitalize on the reflexive relation between students’ verbal exchange and their thinking about concepts that they are learning (Cobb et al., 1995). The process of working together to make sense requires students to clarify the meanings sug­gested by others and in so doing, they also consolidate their own developing understanding. Thus, collaboration is built into the process of the task.Central to the effectiveness of this type of group work is its facilitation. The teacher establishes routines for discus­sion—typically, a problem is posed, students work in small groups to address it, and then the class of students recon­venes as a whole group in order to sort through their under­standing and what they still need to know. In Brown and Campione’s (1994) Oakland classroom, the routine con­sisted of students moving with regularity between work groups (computer composition, research, or working with the teacher), reciprocal teaching or jigsaw seminars, and chat groups that included project presentation/discussions as they tackled their current classrooms queries. In both settings, once the routine is understood, it permits the stu­dents to focus their attention on the tasks that provide the content of their learning, the process of working together and with the teacher on their questions (Brown & Campi­one, 1994; 'Wood, 1995).As Azmitia (1996) points out in her review of peer inter­action across the life span, even young children have been shown to increase their conceptual understanding if en­gaged in tasks that require coordinating ideas into a general theory or rule, resolving disagreements, and so on (cf. Brownell & Carriger, 1991; Tomasello, Kruger, & Ratner, 1993). Not surprisingly, Azmitia also notes age-related dif­ferences in the process of students’ work together on the tasks they are assigned. Specifically, (a) elementary stu­dents generate fewer and more similar kinds of ideas about what to do on a task than do older students, and (b) pre­school and elementary school students are more likely to learn through conflict with another than they are through collaboration (Berkowitz & Gibbs, 1983; Kruger, 1992, 1993). By adolescence, it appears that students are able to build on a partner’s ideas and can use conflict (challenges, disagreement, questioning, etc.) as a means to further come to a joint understanding that neither might have developed independently (Forman & McPhail, 1993).The two areas in which elementary school-aged stu­dents’ capacities for working together are most likely to ev­idence change include: (a) The ability to talk about their roles and (b) the ability to focus on a joint or group goal.248 Developmental Psychology and Instruction: Issues From and For Practicerather than their own contribution to the project (cf. Azmi- tia, 1996; Azmitia & Montgomery, 1993). Interestingly, it is these changes that are critical to the success of collabo­rative learning as a type of flexible grouping, and more re­cent efforts to create collective communities of learners.Presumably, the ability to collaborate on a task is also dependent on how open or closed (how accessible) the task is for the particular students, their questions and connec­tions to it, and the way in which the teacher facilitates their meaning-making through it (see Cobb, 1995; Krummheuer, 1995; Wood, 1995; Yackel, 1995).Training for Group Work. It is not entirely the stu­dents who determine the success of peer tutoring (Fan- tuzzo. Polite, & Grayson, 1990), or, for that matter, any grouping practice. Use of grouping in the classroom is en­hanced by teachers’ efforts to help students develop re­sponsibility for their own learning and a willingness to help their peers learn. This can be accomplished by: (a) Focus­ing on student learning, (b) fostering independence and in­terdependence, (c) emphasizing students responsibility for their own learning, (d) using cooperative and self-directed student learning tasks, (e) giving clear directions, (f) en­couraging self-directed learning strategies, and (g) involv­ing students in peer tutoring (Miller, 1991b; see also Medway, 1991, for similar points regarding effective peer tutoring practice).Hereford (1993) further specifies the importance of (a) frequently reassessing ability group assignments, (b) varying instructional levels and pace, (c) assigning groups based on demonstrated needs and abilities, (d) grouping students for specific subjects, and (e) using ability groups to teach spe­cific skills (see also Sanacore, 1990).Teachers, however, are not usually trained to set up, fa­cilitate, or assess multi-age grouping practices, coopera­tive grouping, peer tutoring, and so on in their classrooms (see Jensen & Green, 1993; Miller, 1991a; Webb & Palinc- sar, 1996). For group work to function effectively, students cannot simply be assigned to groups, and teachers cannot be assumed to use a book in order to figure out how to plan group work that takes into consideration; (a) the skills to be taught, including those necessary for working together in a group; (b) the topic to be covered; and (c) the needs of the students (Lyman, 1991; Palincsar & Klenk, 1991).As Webb and Palincsar (1996) point out, in many schools and classrooms, students have had little opportu­nity to develop the skills needed to work effectively with others. Embedded in cooperative grouping tasks such as the Jigsaw and TGT are specific role and goal prescriptions for each student. The advantage of explicit roles and goalsin these tasks is that both teachers and students know what is expected of them during this kind of group work. For similar reasons, perhaps, reciprocal questioning has been found to be more effective for learning than more open group discussions, presumably because students need to learn how to question or be given permission to do so—that is, they need to be given a role—and teachers need to know how to pose the question (Fantuzzo, Riggio, Connelly, & Dimeff, 1989; King, 1989a, 1989b, 1990).Some projects that have been developed to prepare stu­dents (and teachers) for group work have focused on devel­oping norms for group participation and providing students with instruction. Kagan (1992) developed spe­cific tasks to enable students to develop and practice the skills necessary to work with and trust each other in small groups. These include (a) listening, (b) turn taking, (c) helping, (d) resolving differences, (e) appreciating, (f) en­couraging, (g) staying on task, and (h) asking for help. Team-building and prosocial development activities have also been used to develop spontaneous prosocial behaviors (Solomon, Watson, Schaps, Battistich, & Solomon, 1990) and change in students’ ascribed status expectations for peers (Cohen, Lotan, & Catanzarite, 1990). Other projects have more or less explicitly embedded the process of learning to work together in the process of working on shared tasks. An explicit example is the mathematics learning undertaken in the Teaching Experiment Class­room (Cobb, Wood, & Yackel, 1993). In this type of small group work, the teacher role involves intervening to help the students develop productive relationships (Cobb, 1995, Wood & Yackel, 1990). In this classroom, there was ex­plicit discussion of the importance of persistence, explana­tion of solutions, listening and making sense, and discussion of solutions when conflict arose (Cobb, 1995). Conflict in particular was found to be an important indica­tor of students’ emerging understanding (Cobb, 1995; Krummheuer, 1995).Summary of Research and Reports on GroupingAlthough the different studies and reports : represent a range of foci and grouping types, there is general support for the notion that mixed and flexible grouping can con­tribute positively to students’ academic, social, and emo­tional development. There is also substantial support for adjusting instruction in relation to the particular groupings of students being taught.Although the literature is not conclusive about whether there are optimal methods for assigning students to groups, it does appear that paired or smaller groupings of 3 to 4 stu­dents are optimal. Flexible grouping does appear to provideInstruction; An Overview of Research and Reports 249opportunities for students to consolidate their understand­ing of material through discussion and focused work with others. Findings from studies of cross-age tutoring are the most cohesive on this point. This type of grouping appears to ensure clear academic, social, and emotional gains for both tutor and tutee, presumably because the particular roles and goals in this type of grouping are clear. Findings from this literature indicate that even students who may not feel competent in more traditional instructional formats re­spond positively to being asked to be responsible for what they know, and to having the opportunity to use and build on what they know in their work with one another.Despite a substantial literature on grouping in class­rooms, there appears to be a consensus that students need to learn how to work together in groups and most teachers need both training and support if they are to implement, fa­cilitate, or assess grouping in the classes they teach.CommentWhat does this overview contribute to our thinking about in­structional formats depicted in the two Jurassic Period case formats? Although we are not provided with specific in­formation about the students being taught in the case for­mats described for teaching about what makes the Jurassic Period the Jurassic Period, we know that the range of dif­ferences among them is not extreme. By second grade, stu­dents with severe learning difficulties typically are no longer mainstreamed (part of the regular classroom). Fur­ther, we know that if the lecture format described a class­room of gifted students, these students might learn as effectively and would perhaps cover more content than those in a more interactive class. We also know that it might be particularly important to attend to their feelings about themselves relative to the others in their class and as students of the content being covered.The same gifted students, if taught using the approach described in the interactive format, would probably have a more highly developed conceptual understanding of the material covered, greater comfort with themselves as peer collaborators, and an increased sense of control in relation to their contributions to the classroom knowledge base. They would feel secure in their knowledge and be in a posi­tion to generate questions, having worked on learning to do this together with the others in their class.If the students are average or low-ability students, on the other hand, it might be expected that they would learn less in the lecture format than in the interactive format, since the requirements for listening could present difficul­ties for them. Taught through an interactive format, how­ever, the students would help to generate the questions onwhich they would be focused, and would therefore have more ready access to the material to be learned. This in turn would enable them to move on to consolidate their un­derstanding of the topics and skills to be mastered.In addition to the issues of topic coverage and skill de­velopment, however, the interactive format offers all stu­dents experience with different types of flexible grouping. Such experience encourages them to individually and col­lectively develop a coherent narrative about the topic as they work to express their ideas and questions about the material on which they are working. It allows them to work with others who have a similar level of familiarity with the material being introduced, but who bring different sets of experience to their work with it. Finally, the interactive format provides students with a basis for belonging to and being part of a community of learners.What does the topic of grouping contribute more generally to how we think about student learning and its implications for instruction? Technically, all classrooms are mixed-age classrooms, since students in single-age classes often range in age by as much as two years. In addition, students in all classrooms vary in their levels of experience and compe­tence with the material being taught (cf. Gardner, 1983; Sternberg, 1996), perhaps even more so in tracked or abil­ity-based grouping, since students are typically gifted in particular domains (cf. Feldman, 1980; Meeker, 1976). As Goodlad and Anderson (1963) point out, grouping children on the basis of a single criterion does not produce a homo­geneous group. It appears, however, that unless classes are labeled “mixed,” or are organized for an interactive format, teachers perceive themselves as working with groups of students who are similar, using methods designed to distin­guish between those who complete the assigned tasks and those who have difficulty.In addition to highlighting student variation for teach­ers, mixed grouping affords opportunities for student learning not available in homogeneous grouping—not avail­able in classes where instruction is premised on homo­geneity. Working in flexible groups, for example, enables students to (a) access prior knowledge because they can pool their understanding in order to complete a task; (b) engage in discussions leading to more sophisticated learning than they could accomplish independently in a relatively short amount of time; (c) share their interest or connection to the materials being covered, which in turn provides a scaffold to the materials for other students; and (d) have peer models for strategies necessary to task completion.Grouping further influences the process of students’ work on tasks because in groups, students (a) engage a250 Developmental Psychology and Instruction: Issues From and For Practicerange of perspectives on a topic that provides the basis for their emerging understanding of that concept, and (b) are provided with the incremental scaffolding and reworking of concepts (the practice) necessary for conceptual develop­ment. Finally, grouping influences the product of student work: Skudents not only accomplish the assigned tasks, but their frame of reference and strategies for working with and using the concepts they have been studying are en­riched—especially if instruction about and reflection on the process of their work occurs.Students do need to learn how to work in groups, how­ever. Based on the literature presented, there are at least three ways to undertake this process; (a) adjustment of goals and roles in the task while working on subject matter, (b) focus on learning to work in groups as the subject mat­ter, or (c) immersion in classroom-based problem solving. Presumably each of these approaches might be effective, especially if coupled with explicit information about stu­dent goals and teacher facilitation of goals, including stu­dent reflection (cf. Pressley et al., 1989). The relative merits of teaching a particular group of students through one method or another can only be decided based on infor­mation about their strengths and needs when involved in group work and the learning to be accomplished (and what the teacher is in a position to try).Tasks can be assigned to provide for multiple points of access and differences among students. (See Cohen, 1988 for a useful discussion.) Basic information about how open or closed a task is and its effects on the ways in which stu­dents access, process, and are then able to complete the tasks they are assigned appears to be central to understand­ing how group work (or any other kind of instruction) might be adjusted and sequenced to meet students’ strengths and needs.It is also clear that teachers need to have more knowl­edge about and support for learning how grouping can be used in the classroom. In addition, they may need to know more about how students learn so as to be able to use grouping in the classroom effectively to meet their stu­dents’ needs (cf. Rings & Sheets, 1991).What might we still want to know about grouping based on developmental theory and research? Although much of the work focuses on students in elementary school, the lit­erature reviewed informs the use of grouping with students at the preschool level through high school. Students have been studied across different content areas and schools, as subjects in basic research and as students in whose class grouping of some type was being practiced. We generally do not know anything about their (or their teachers ) prior experience with grouping or their particular abilities tohandle the content and skills of the grouping in which they are involved. This is complicated because the opportunities for richer learning afforded by group work are conflated with the need to work with students on their learning m small groups. Without information about what experience with group work the students and the teacher being studied have, it is difficult to know where they fit in the continuum of learning to use group work. Furthermore, we have not explicitly addressed the roles of task accessibility and its effect on group process in this literature.At this time, there is work that suggests that grouping is an effective instructional technique, that during group work, students develop the skills to assume and share re­sponsibility for problem solving, and that with age (or per­haps experience?) students are increasingly able to focus on joint or group goals. Flexible grouping, however, also af­fords possibilities for the development of misconceptions (cf. Forman & McPhail, 1993; Levin & Druyan, 1993) and the breakdown of students’ abilities to work together (Azmitia, 1996). We know very little about the links be­tween open-ended learning experiences, such as those af­forded by group work, the development of misconception or faulty information about either content being covered or skills being learned, and the subject matter.Presumably, there are more and less opportune times to involve students in flexible groups as a function of their un­derstanding of the material to be covered, their readiness to work together, and/or the structure of the task. Are these links different if there is a reward or a demand structure because the teacher has determined the task to be accom­plished instead of the student helping to determine the task? At present, information about what works appears dependent on teacher intuition. Can we assume that there are increasingly complex demands represented by open- ended or less structured sets of tasks, and that these can be sequenced in order to facilitate the development of stu­dents’ abilities to work together in groups (e.g., moving from two-person buzz groups to small groups of three or four for a discrete task, moving back to the large group to reflect on work carried out in groups, and so on)? Or is it the case that if we want students to be problem solvers, it is more advantageous to immerse them in open-ended tasks? Certainly, for many students open-ended tasks are likely to be discrepant relative to their expectations about learn­ing. Possibly because of this, they might just pique their curiosity (cf. Berlyne, 1960). Brown and Campione (1994) and the Cognition and Technology Group at Vanderbilt (Hickey, Moore, & Pellegrino, in press) report high levels of engagement by students who otherwise might be expected to resist alternative formats for learning (cf.Issues from and for Practice 251D’Amato, 1996). For students who have not been able to connect to more traditional forms of learning, it is tasks such as these that provide enough in the way of support or scaffolding to enable them to begin taking responsibility for themselves as learners (Slavin, 1990).There is little research that documents the processes and concepts students and their teachers need to engage in order to learn from and use groups effectively in the class­room, much less the way in which these are mediated by the accessibility of the task for students or students’ abilities to process these tasks effectively. Furthermore, what do teachers (and students and parents) need to know or see in order to be willing to do the problem solving involved in learning to work with and adjust grouping tasks in their classrooms? Documentation of change across time in stu­dents’ abilities to engage particular types of group work in subject areas could be quite useful for teachers who have a hard time imagining their own students ever being able to handle such challenges. As Rosenshine and Meister (1994) comment in their review of the research on reciprocal teaching, one of the limitations of reciprocal teaching is that little attention is given to issues of implementation. (The interested reader is encouraged to look at Marks et al.’s, 1993, efforts to document adaptations of reciprocal teaching in classrooms.) Not only do teachers need clarity about these areas, but researchers, too, need to understand the contextual issues that affect the variables to which they address themselves (see Damon, 1997), since better docu­mentation of implementation facilitates replication and extension of findings.Information about how students perceive the use of group work in their classes, and how this perception shifts with increased experience in groups, may also be useful for teachers concerned about when and how to incorporate group work into their classes. Furthermore, given that groupings such as Jigsaw and TGT can function to facili­tate students’ abilities to break through stereotypes and learn to develop the ability to work with others on tasks (cf. Aronson et al., 1978; Slavin, 1983), it would be useful to teachers to know more about the implications of assign­ing friends—or nonfriends—to work together during sub­ject-area learning, and how task access variables would mediate this.Studies providing teachers with a clear understanding of the primary task elements to which they might pay atten­tion while planning student work in groups (and as students work in groups) would also be quite useful. These could provide a basis for understanding how to build into instruc­tion periods of reflection about both the topics being ad­dressed and group process. They could also provide a basisfor thinking about how to monitor students’ efforts in the present in order to adjust and sequence subsequent tasks.Finally, what does it look like as students learn to take responsibility for their own learning in group work? Do age, level of expertise in subject matter, and different school cultures affect the ways in which they learn to adjust the roles they assume in group work and their ability to en­gage in joint goal setting? Are students’ abilities to assume responsibility for themselves as learners mediated by whether they help to set tasks for themselves or need to meet the demands of a task that is set for them?ISSUES FROM AND FOR PRACTICE The Language of InstructionWhat does the literature overviewed provide us in the way of answers to the questions from practice posed at the out­set of the chapter? (Is it always bad to give students a task they cannot complete? What do I do with the four kids who just can’t keep up with the work? Why don’t students learn better when I’ve given them something interesting to read? How do I get my students to discuss something? Should stu­dents keep the same partners for all of their lab periods? Why aren’t my students learning anything when they do small group work?)First, the literature suggests that there is not one answer to such educational questions. There are many ways to con­duct a lecture or run a discussion, and except for the litera­ture on cross-age tutoring, studies of student achievement in lectures, discussions, questioning, and grouping all re­flect mixed findings. Second, the literature suggests that regardless of type (gifted, average, or atypical), all stu­dents benefit when instruction is adjusted. Furthermore, students may achieve more and feel better about them­selves in some settings than in others; students can learn to work with new instructional formats; they profit from hav­ing prior knowledge used as a basis for their learning in any format; they may need to be helped to develop strategies if achievement is a goal; and the way in which the teacher asks questions, engages students in discussion, uses com­puters, and so on affects the way in which the students do each of these things. Finally, the findings suggest that teachers are likely to need help thinking about how to use lectures, discussions, questioning, and grouping in their classrooms.More specifically, it seems that teachers may need to recognize that the questions they pose about classroom practice are subjects for further discussion, not discrete252 Developmental Psychology and Instruction: Issues From and For Practiceanswers. Discrete answers overlook the issue of who stu­dents are (what they need as learners) and whether they know how to implement the answer. Based on this overview, it also appears that teachers need to identify possible an­swers to their questions through conversation with others, use of self-questions, or in work with text, and so on.The literature provides information basic to beginning to answer teachers’ questions—here, for example, this in­cludes the information that students benefit from having prior knowledge, reflection (metacognition), and instruc­tion about strategies embedded or built into subject matter on which they are working. The questions posed above, however, belong to the teachers. Teachers know about their context of instruction and their students, and this informa­tion is not in the literature. Teachers also are the ones who make decisions about both the academic goals (i.e., learn­ing to summarize, describing what a problem asks in their own words) and the behavioral goals (i.e., staying on task, learning to listen) for the students in their classes. Given that teachers have the information necessary to begin working on or gathering resources for answering the ques­tions they pose, they may need to know that they can an­swer them. Some teachers (just like some students), may need to recognize first that they have questions about teaching (as opposed to simply having information about what to do). Some teachers (like some students), may need to learn how to locate and develop strategies in order to make use of resources. The literature represents a set of re­sources, as does further education, some in-service train­ing, and so on. In order for teaching to reflect findings from research in developmental psychology, however, teachers, like their students, may need a way to connect their questions to the possibilities inherent in the develop­mental literature.In order for these connections to be developed, it ap­pears to be a necessary condition that teachers contextual­ize their questions—that they anchor them in their own classrooms, with their own students, within the particular content area they are teaching. This is the basis of “action research” (cf. Oja & Smulyan, 1989), a method of research in which teachers pose questions, that, together with re­searchers, are then studied in their own classrooms.From this perspective, teaching can be conceptualized as an ongoing (developmental) process of collecting and developing resources that permit the fine-tuning of content knowledge and skills for working with students (see Lieberman, 1995; Little, 1990). When combined with in­formation from the research literature and reports about others’ practice, action research provides a basis for seri­ous consideration of questions from practice.There is, however, another set of considerations. While at one level of analysis, the literature on instruction largely corroborates points outlined in the synthesis of the devel­opmental work (markers of transition and qualitative changes in understanding, such as the importance of stu­dents posing and answering their own questions, the bene­fits of building on prior knowledge in the organization of tasks, involving students in reflecting on their understand­ing about their own learning as a means for calling their attention to the problem under consideration and the strate­gies they are using), it also is more focused on student achievement and the need to train teachers about using tasks than on how students learn. Therefore, terms such as task access, task process, prior knowledge, metacognition, and students are all somewhat differently construed.Discussion of task access in the literature on instruction is largely focused on the means for getting students to com­plete tasks, or motivating them to engage in tasks, rather than on individual (or group-based) variability in the way in which they go about working on tasks—identifying the prob­lem under examination (not assuming that because it has been stated or presented that it is therefore understood), considering links between the problem and what they have as information about it, considering resources available for working with the problem, and so on. In fact, it appears that, with the exception of the literature on questioning and class­room-based problem solving, the notion of student access to a task is fused with that of student work on a task. As a re­sult, distinct indices of student processing, such as use of strategies, are more likely to be linked to the demands of the task than to differences among students in their ability to use them, or changes in the way they are used. This means, for example, that the literature on instruction emphasizes the nature of the task, the method of instruction, and the need to embed strategies in the task, rather than focusing on whether students are already employing some strategies, which ones, and perhaps how they understand their use.Similarly, while the literature on instruction indicates convergence on the importance of metacognition and strat­egy training as contributors to student learning, this often takes the form of describing the importance of, say, dis­course or summaries for student achievement. The role of reflection in bringing the student to the point of being able to identify the problem and learn strategies for working is therefore often subsumed in the focus on achievement. In fact, if achievement is the goal, then assisting students to be able to describe the problems with which they are working and developing their abilities to work with them—including use of discourse and/or strategies for summarizing—may actually mean that students can achieve.Issues from and for Practice 253The literature overviewed also attests to the importance of providing opportunities for students to work together on learning. Typically, however, students’ connections with other students as motivators or methods for engaging stu­dents in tasks are emphasized, rather than the role of the small group in enabling students to consolidate their under­standing through working with others who are endeavoring to develop a language of strategy use, representing infor­mation in different formats, and the practice involved in re­working materials so that they become their own (task process).Furthermore, little current attention is being given to the notion of open and closed tasks—tasks that afford mul­tiple opportunities for students to access them, as opposed to tasks that do not. It appears that if open tasks such as those used in classroom-based problem solving (Bereiter & Scardamalia, 1992; Brown & Campione, 1994; Cobb et al., 1995; Cognition and Technology Group at Vanderbilt, in press) heighten task accessibility for students, the diffi­culty of accessing more closed tasks may well account for the mixed results that characterize student performance on those tasks. In fact, the only literature that does not report mixed results is that on cross-age tutoring. In cross-age tu­toring, presumably, the tutor is naturally inclined to adjust the task in the course of working with his or her tutee even if he or she is not reflectively aware of such adjustment.Students’ needs are also described in the literature on instruction in terms of a characteristic of disaffected stu­dents, of students in the first year of a subject, and so on, rather than being based in more particularized understand­ings and misconceptions of an individual or a specific class of students. There is another whole literature in education that specifically focuses on individualization. This litera­ture is typically the province of special educators. As such, it may not be surprising that where individualized needs of students are addressed, these are primarily those of atypi­cal learners or special-needs students. Even the literature on individualization, however, focuses on the needs of stu­dents by type, rather than on particular groups of students in particular classrooms.There is good reason to focus on the level of the task and on types of students rather than the level of the student or students in a particular classroom. Discussion at the level of the task is expedient; the parameters of the task can be specified and the requisite procedures itemized. On the other hand, the literature on instruction does consistently address teachers’ needs to be trained to use each of the types of instruction overviewed, suggesting that limiting the discussion of tasks and students to the level of the generic classroom is not sufficient for changed practice.The generic classroom does not provide information specific to how instruction needs to be adjusted, such as what students already know, what they still need to under­stand about the skills, discourse-knowledge, and them­selves as learners of the subject—and then in relation to this information: what materials to select for the class­room; what tasks to choose and how they might be orga­nized and reorganized for use in a particular classroom setting; selection of questioning; and choice of responses to a range of differences in classroom composition (SES, atypicality, gender, etc.).Based on the literature overviewed, however, it does not appear that there is any compelling reason for educators to ask questions about these topics or to seek out answers from research. The process of adjusting iqstruction to meet strengths and needs of particular students is not part of the language with which they or their mentors typically work. In fact, many of the assignments given to education students, such as designing lesson plans or curriculum projects, em­phasize the subject matter and tasks employed and de-em- phasize the role of the student(s) as influencing how, why, and when particular materials and tasks might be employed.Developmental Psychology and PracticeIt might be useful to consider how the working knowledge of developmental psychologists described at the outset of this chapter maps onto the literature reviewed. This working knowledge has been described as including the following;1. Each student’s knowledge or understanding is individu­ally constructed in relation to the others (i.e., the teacher, other students) and objects (i.e., texts, com­puter software, classroom rituals, assigned tasks) in the environment;2. The process of apprehending or perceiving something (i.e., a concept) involves readiness in terms of atten- tional capacity, short-term memory, prior knowledge or experience, individual interest, and the particular affor- dances of or actions suggested by, the task including how situated within a particular context the learning is;3. What the individual attends to influences what he or she represents to him- or herself; and4. What individuals represent to themselves in turn affects the particular action or sets of actions in which they en­gage or are ready to engage.Based on the literature overviewed, it appears that educa­tors are most familiar with the terms raised in (2), for254 Developmental Psychology and Instruction: Issues From and For Practiceexample, student attention, prior knowledge, and interest. Given that the literature is largely focused on achievement of types of students and task access is yoked to the process of working on tasks, it is also understandable why teachers might be inclined to simply think about these as terms to describe why students have difficulty, rather than as a call for action.It would be ideal if psychological distance or some other construct could help us to clearly identify a student’s current level of understanding about a given topic with ref­erence to a next step within a well-understood (by the teacher) set of not necessarily linearly related conceptual attainments, which, in turn, would lead to flexible under­standing of a given topic. By definition, however, psycho­logical distance cannot do this for the teacher or the researcher, nor can another construct. What the construct of psychological distance can do is to provide a guide for parameters that need to be considered if the goal is to facil­itate change. For change in students’ learning, these para­meters include assessing what is known and what needs to be known in terms of the possible action or set of actions or distancing necessary to close the gap between them.Thus, for example, in long-term (i.e., 3 weeks) lesson planning, a teacher working within the parameters set by the construct of psychological distance might identify the topic to be covered and take stock of the students with whom he or she is working in terms of (a) their strengths and needs behaviorally (i.e., listening to other students, fo­cusing on the task assigned, working with others in small groups) and (b) their strengths and needs academically (i.e., ability to explain what the problem posed is asking, comparing and contrasting perspectives, using resources other than the teacher when they have questions). Follow­ing this, the teacher would be in a position to target two or three academic and behavioral needs on which to focus, and could chart the sequence of small steps or adjustments necessary to enable the students to learn the topic including its connections to the subject area as a whole, in turn, de­veloping their skills as learners and as students of the sub­ject area.^‘It might be helpful to the reader to know that this is an assign­ment that I regularly give to student teachers during the fourth week of their practice-teaching experience. It typically provides them with enough of a scaffold to move from being dependent on their cooperating teacher and supervisor to assuming responsi­bility for the class in consultation with these people. I also have used this task as an opening exercise for workshops with teach­ers. Similar to a self-question, it grounds subsequent discussion in their situation, strengths, and needs.The teacher who employs psychological distance as a tool for thinking about changed action imposes his or her understanding of learning on its parameters. It is this teacher who has—or does not have—the content knowledge necessary to make informed decisions about where a stu­dent’s knowledge falls along the continuum of information that is known. It is also this person who has—or does not have—an understanding of how students learn and the im­plications of this information for how they might most effectively be taught.Herein, then, are at least two of the tensions that emerge in considering the implications of developmental psychol­ogy for practice. First, the teacher cannot be overlooked in the effort to instruct students. Second, it is neither practi­cal nor developmentally appropriate to overspecify what teachers should do in working with students.The Role of the TeacherBased on the working knowledge about student develop­ment and the overview of the research on instruction, it follows that learning can be enhanced by tasks that are se­quenced so that students will further develop their under­standing of the content to be learned by being led to re-represent it to themselves. In school, these experiences are typically afforded by texts, other students, and the teacher.It is usually the teacher who selects texts and juxtaposes them with other resources, and it is the teacher who makes decisions about the tasks used in teaching and the use of grouping within the classroom. Furthermore, it is the teacher who sets the context for and models the use of questioning, reflection, and strategy use. Unfortunately, as a host of authors have pointed out (cf. Cuban, 1984; Gregg, 1995; Sirotnik, 1983), the model that many teachers repre­sent does not map onto working knowledge about how stu­dents learn or what is understood about instruction. As Sirotnik (1983) observes, ‘“The modus operand!’ of the typical classroom is still didactics, practice, and little else” (p. 17).Thus, at the same time that research-driven practice, teacher education, and inservice programs are in place, there is still a gulf between practice and what Brown and Campione (1994) describe as the “first principles of learn­ing”: Learning that (a) is active; (b) includes metacognition,(c) acknowledges multiple zones of proximal development;(d) is based in dialogue (shared discourse, negotiated mean­ing, seeding conversations, legitimizing difference); (e) en­genders a community of practice; and (f) addresses content that is contextualized and situated. What Brown and Campi­one have achieved is the specification of developmentallyIssues from and for Practice 255appropriate endpoints—the basis for what Cohen (1989) has described as “adventurous teaching.”These principles echo findings reported in the litera­ture. They build on students’ attention to the task, their need to represent tasks to themselves, and the benefits of a context for learning that facilitates opportunities for active work on reconstructing what has been understood. The complication is that even adventurous teachers can be chal­lenged when they try to figure out how to take these words and work with them in the classroom (Wilson, Miller, & Yerkes, 1993).As suggested earlier, one reason for this may be that de­velopmental psychologists, even those sincerely committed to educational practice, only appear to speak the same lan­guage as educators. The idea of a group of second graders adjusting a task for themselves would be likely to sound like mayhem, particularly if you did not have models with which to work or the support to begin working on restruc­turing the way in which you have been teaching. It would sound like mayhem if you did not think in terms of individ­ual students, but instead about students in general, and when you thought about students generally you thought about generic types of students, and when you thought about tasks you thought about closed tasks because they were the types of tasks you assigned and understood your­self to be expected to assign.We need to consider seriously and without judgment what is understood about how students learn and the impli­cations of this understanding for how they should be taught. What does the person who considers classroom- based problem solving to be the equivalent of mayhem un­derstand about it? (How does he or she identify the problem?) This is where a discussion of first principles for practice needs to begin. Given this information, and a sense of the literature or first principles that ean be dis­tilled from the literature, it becomes possible to think about how to begin to coordinate educators’ and researchers’ un­derstanding of possibilities for practice.Another complication is that there is a history of gifted researchers from leading universities who have described the problems of education largely in terms of curriculum.They assumed that students should learn largely on their own as they “discovered” ideas, “did” mathematics, “messed about in science,” and the like. But these eminent professors knew as little of schools ... as they imagined most teachers knew about science. . . . They were particularly ignorant of how classroom teachers might apprehend and use novel mate­rials. As it turned out, few teachers gave students much chance to independently use the new curricula. Hence whenteachers used the materials, they did so in ways that made sense to them. Since few knew much of the new science, that meant that their use of the curricula typically was guided both by the inherited knowledge and pedagogy that reformers wanted to circumvent and by teachers’ struggles with prob­lems that reformers had never considered, like classroom management and local politics. The curriculum reformers’ passion for active learning led them to overestimate the mate­rials’ independent power, and their ignorance about schools and teaching led them to underestimate teachers’ influence on the use of the materials. (Cohen & Barnes, 1993, p. 215)Based on present research findings, it is no longer appro­priate to assume that students will independently generate the questions and strategies that enable them to learn. In­stead, it is recognized that there is a need to focus on stu­dents’ abilities to connect to curricula and the skills the student needs to develop in order to have access to tasks. Furthermore, teachers need to adjust instruction accord­ingly, for purposes of management as well as local under­standing. This may, of course, involve recognizing that the students are independently generating questions and strate­gies. It may involve recognizing that students are doing this some of the time and with support might be able to do so more of the time (i.e.. How did you make that decision? Will you walk me through your thinking here? I’d like to know what you are doing. How did you think about that? What is the connection between [the topics and skills pre­viously covered, a self-question, etc.] and your efforts here?). Finally, it may necessitate more direct instruction in order to prepare the students to begin assuming responsi­bility for making their own connections to the topics they are to learn.Using a task (or a curriculum) exactly as it is described is a first approximation to working with students on learn­ing. If its premises are not understood, it can also be a little like an algorithm. Adjusting instruction involves under­standing the intentions of the curriculum design and/or in­structional practice, recognizing that questions to be posed may need to be tailored to the class in which they are being used, the length of time used to carry through on a task may need to be adjusted and the task itself broken into smaller units at least initially, the mode of presenting the tasks to the students may need to include alternative and repeated formats given the needs of the students, and so on.The task that works effectively for one group of students may not work for the next; instruction that was effective at the beginning of the year is not necessarily going to work at the end of the year (Good & Stipek, 1983). The teacher needs to assume responsibility (or be allowed to assume256 Developmental Psychology and Instruction: Issues From and For Practiceresponsibility) for how the tasks in his or her class are adjusted and sequenced. The teacher also needs to feel comfortable about changing his or her mind and experi­menting—two qualities that run counter to an expectation that teachers know what they are doing and have the cor­rect answers. As Charney (1997) points out, it is:a common misconception that good teachers do not have problems ... the issue is not how to make teaching problem- free, but how to dignify and honor the problem-solving pro­cess that is inherent to good teaching. We must pay attention to the questions, the evidence, and the sources that yield our best results and find the time to share with our colleagues the realities of our classroom so we can solve problems together.(p. 1)Practice should look quite different from one classroom to the next (Brown & Campione, 1994). Encouraging teachers to adjust tasks, however, also means that the researcher needs to sacrifice authority over instructional practice as well as traditional expectations for experimental control.The Role of SpecificationTasks that enable teachers to use research in practice clearly need to be specified and disseminated. It is criti­cal, however, that they neither be overspecified nor under­stood as such—the teacher needs to work with his or her students, just as the students need to work with the con­tent about which they are learning. Attempting to teacher- proof tasks (design curricula that works for the students even if the teacher does not understand it) reflects short­sightedness on the part of researchers and has been the downfall of many curriculum efforts (cf. Cohen & Barnes, 1993; Popkewitz, Tabachnick, & Wehlage, 1982; Sarason, 1982).There is far too much variance in the study of social sci­ence to be able to claim that all conditions for learning are equal (Cronbach & Snow, 1977) or, conversely, that an al­gorithm about instruction will apply to all settings. The dictums of effective research according to Smith (1997), and thus the expectations of effective practice—that find­ings be generalizable or practice be appropriate for all stu­dents, that tasks minimize variability or be executed in particular ways, and that attention be focused on optimal cases or particular indices rather than others are no longer completely tenable. Instead, as described by the tetrahedral model, the process of learning appears to be most accurately characterized as multidimensional. This lens permits theory building that addresses the real per­formances and real intelligences” of students withoutdismissing data (Smith, 1997; see also Smith & Thelen, 1993). It involves working with patterns of individual vari­ation in learning and study of the organization and transi­tions of these patterns over time.Interestingly enough, however, research on individual differences or individual variation has met a relatively quick demise each time it has surfaced in the literature. The major reason for this appears to be the overwhelming numbers of interactions that have been perceived to need documentation when individual differences are studied (cf. Cronbach & Snow, 1977). This perception is logically consistent with two principles that have dominated think­ing about learning and instruction—that there is one way to complete tasks, and that there is a discrete set of ap­proaches for working with students.At present, it is clear that there are multiple approaches to completing tasks and a number of ways of facilitating student learning. Tracking specific interactions is far less useful than identifying patterns of individual variation, except in the case of instances that arise in a particular classroom.In practice, where there are four or so students in a classroom who are having real difficulty working with a task, and, as a result, are acting out and disturbing others, it makes a significant difference to the functioning of the classroom if the teacher can figure out what these students already understand and what they still need to understand with respect to their understanding of concepts, skill devel­opment, and their sense of themselves as learners. In such cases, the focus is specifically directed to the individual or the group of individuals who are having difficulty and their strengths and needs in the particular situation. It should be noted that such adjustments to classroom instruction typi­cally serve to enhance the learning of other students as well as that of the targeted students, since they involve more fo­cused development of skills, and so on. Furthermore, this approach has also proven to be an effective management technique for teachers. Students want to be able to do the tasks assigned in the classroom; however, they need to be able to connect to them in order to do so.Somewhat similarly. Comer, Haynes, and Joyner (1996) report that as they began collaboration on the School De­velopment Program in the 1970s, they focused the atten­tion of all parties involved on students and their need for interactions that would provide a predictable and caring environment for each of them. They found that once atten­tion was focused on each student’s learning, there was no longer any expectation that students would all learn in the same way or that there would be one way to teach them. It appears that focusing on individual students provides aIssues from and for Practice 257necessary lens for adjusting instruction to meet their strengths and needs.Commenting on the same program, Gillette and Kranyik (1996) observe that “For an individual teacher and for a school, taking development seriously is a major cultural transformation” (p. 150). They continue to suggest that such work of necessity begins with an appreciation that all students can learn—information that is basic to the work­ing knowledge of developmental psychologists, but which is not typical of most school cultures where the focus is on performance, and where students are given and take on la­bels like “intelligent,” “underachiever,” or “creative.”In fact, there has been a recent surge of educator interest in “multiple intelligences” (Gardner, 1983)—that is, recog­nition that students (and people generally) have a range of strengths and weaknesses, for example, linguistic, per­sonal, logico-deductive, bodily-kinesthetic, and so on. This theory has called educators’ attention to issues of differ­ence and the possibility that tasks and assessment practices need to be more broadly defined than they once were (Williams et al., 1996).^^For practitioners, attention to patterns of individual variation might be usefully understood as requiring atten­tion to particular individuals (or groups of individuals) in their particular classroom rather than classification of stu­dents as types. This focus enables teachers to act in re­sponse to specific information on the basis of which they are in a position to effect change.For the researcher, patterns of individual variation are most usefully described in terms of within-individual func­tioning rather than particular individuals. At this more general level, the researcher is in a position to provide teachers with basic information about potential sources of within-student difference as this affects task access and process (i.e., boys are more likely to use visualization as a strategy for recall on passages that are about topics of in­terest than on passages about topics for which they have a noninterest, whereas girls are more likely to use visualiza­tion as a strategy for recall on passages that are about topicsOne complication is that the theory of multiple intelligences has also been subject to assimilation and can be offered as an ex­planation for difference and lack of progress rather than as an impetus for adjusted or broadened curricula. One explanation for this may be that the concept of multiple intelligences is often overviewed for educators by others rather than read and processed by the educators themselves, meaning that educators are not put in a situation where they need to revise or reconstruct what they already know and consider the notion of multiple in­telligences in relation to that.of noninterest to them than on passages about topics for which they have an interest [Renninger & Stavis, 1995]). The teacher can infer implications from this work for prac­tice. It can provide the basis for experimenting with task adjustment. This type of research also suggests another lens for thinking about, say, student strategy use: informa­tion about the particular strategies that are used by stu­dents at this age on this kind of task, evidence that there is not one effective strategy for all students, and so on. Such information contributes to the repertoire of knowledge that teachers have about students as learners generally and about strategy use more specifically. It can also contribute to the kind of language they have available for describing student learning—a language, that includes “likelihood,” consideration of contextualized information, gender, and so on.Information from research only specifies general pat­terns, however. The teacher still needs to adjust and se­quence instruction for his or her class, and is in a position to do so, in this case, with an enhanced sense of the possi­bilities for students’ use of strategy and aspects of task access. This is no small job. It involves recognizing that not all tasks will be as useful for some students as for others, that there will be a wide range of approaches to tasks even when a task itself is closed, and that there are always other variables to be considered. With continued research efforts to detail the patterns of within-student variation for partic­ular types of problem solving across grade levels and school culture, teachers will have available an increasingly articu­lated repertoire of information about possibilities for stu­dent learning and implications for instruction.The researchers’ findings almost always speak only to the general case. It is the teachers who remain ultimately responsible for working with the particular students as­signed to their class(es) that year. The teachers are the ones with information about possibilities in terms of individual (or particular group) functioning and about principles for learning and, as such, are in a position to optimize student learning, including how students feel about themselves as learners of a discipline.Let us return briefly to the question posed at the begin­ning of the chapter about whether small group work is nec­essarily better than lecturing. It should be obvious by now that if the concern involves student learning, this question needs further clarification. For what purposes, for which groups of students, and given this information, how has small group work and lecturing been adjusted for use with the students? What instructional tasks does it precede and follow? Using small group work—or any other instruc­tional task—as a benchmark of effective instruction has its258 Developmental Psychology and Instruction: Issues From and For Practicelimitations (see Good et al„ 1990; Noddings, 1985, 1989).In order to answer the question, two additional pieces of in­formation are necessary: How and why is the small group work and the lecturing being employed?Coordinating Research and PracticeNot only do developmental psychologists and educators ap­pear to have somewhat different languages for describing student learning, there are differences in the kinds of ques­tions they pose and the kinds of answers each might expect. Furthermore, developmental psychologists and teachers typically have different concerns—studying and writing about student development versus working with students.The four types of teacher groups that are seriously en­gaged in implementing current research on student learning in their practice include:1. Those in dire straits who have become part of teacher projects” because their schools have looked to these as a source of support (cf. Comer et al., 1996);2. Those who are interested in curriculum development and see in the standards of their disciplines methods Aat could enhance their own teaching, or provide justifica­tion for what they have already been trying to use in their classrooms (cf. Wilson et al., 1993);3. Those in teacher workshops and inservices who are learning how to ask questions, generate summaries, problem solve, and participate in small groups, just as their students might (cf. Baird & Northfield, 1992; Cognition and Technology Group at Vanderbilt, 1991, Palincsar & Klenk, 1991); and4. Those who in working with a forum such as the World Wide Web or a networked group of teachers find sam­ples of projects and discussions about teaching that, over time, provide enough support for them to see alternate possibilities and ask questions that lead to changed practice (cf. Renninger et al., 1997; Webb & Romberg, 1994).These teachers have in common a sense that there are alter­natives to present practice and real support for engaging in change—not in the form of a half-day inservice or the monthly visit of yet two other people from some project, but months and years of shared time working together, focused on a particular learning environment, and developing a com­mon language and set of purposes for talking and working together. In this kind of coordination of research and prac­tice, there is little emphasis on learning the terminology orfacts of research and more emphasis on exploring alterna­tive practices (the implications of the research). There also is little emphasis on demanding that all teachers do the same things on the same timeline. Some teachers have less active or even passive roles initially. They watch the project or effort unfold and elect to join in at some later time (sometimes as much as three years later, according to I. Mitchell, 1992).Without support for attending to research on student learning, however, teachers may not be inclined to do so— partly because the language of instruction typically used by educators does not describe it as a process of adjusting tasks to meet particular strengths and needs of students. Most preservice (student) teachers do not take courses that address student learning and development for more than one or two class periods. What they are taught, further­more, is typically filtered through the lens of the instruc­tional literature. Issues of task access, if addressed, are specified in terms of types of students rather than the ac­tual functioning of particular students and the range of patterns that such functioning can depict.It is also likely that there is a range of misunderstanding about the respective and complementary roles of research on student learning and practice. Typically, teachers also have had little direct experience with research on student learning. They are not clear about the distinctions to be made between general patterns and particular instances in their efforts to apply research—in fact, the notion of re­search is frightening for many, and they generally do not think about the possibility of seeking implications for prac­tice from research.Regardless of the particular reason(s), it appears impor­tant that both researchers and teachers coordinate what they do know. Our understanding of student learning is cur­rently at a point where findings from disparate foci (i.e., children’s language, strategy use in mathematics, etc.) have begun to converge in their descriptions of students access to and processing of tasks. Similarly, the literatures on instruction that have been overviewed suggest a need for teachers to consider approaches to working with students that are consistent with their prior knowledge, and involve opportunities to question and to work with the material they are presented. Furthermore, studies of performance have not yielded conclusive evidence. In fact, there is some suggestion across the literatures on instruction that tasks of all types are more effective if they are adjusted, and that teachers need to learn how to do this.The coordination of research and practice could begin with a description of what the roles and goals of each in­clude (cf. Slavin, 1983). It also probably needs to buildAppendix: A Second Case in Two Formats 259on examinations of what is (Genishi, 1992b; Gillette & Kranyik, 1996; Jervis, 1996) and what is not exemplary. Fi­nally, it needs to consider seriously what has not worked, as well as what has. For example, if one is going to start an af­terschool tutoring project focused on homework for stu­dents in a housing project, it will be very helpful if previous attempts were recorded, enabling such an effort to build on the efforts of others even if they failed.Furthermore, it appears likely that rather than thinking about teachers as being resistant to change, it might be more appropriate to appreciate that mandated change based on an understanding of student learning is not something to which teachers are likely to have access. Providing teachers with logical explanations about why change is useful is only a partial solution. Teachers really need to know what to do: this is how they were previously taught, and this is where coordination of a shared language about student learning and practice needs to begin (cf. Palincsar & Klenk, 1991).One approach to coordinating research and practice in­volves collaboration of researchers and practitioners (cf. Bruer, 1993). For students, teachers, and researchers in such projects, it appears that the process of working collab- oratively affords the possibility of new understanding—un­derstanding that none could have developed independently (Cognition and Technology Group at Vanderbilt, 1996; Damon, 1997; Wilson et al., 1993). Such collaboration also requires an ongoing discussion about what is and is not working in the collaboration, and why (I. Mitchell, 1992).Another approach to developing a shared language in­volves rethinking the way in which we disseminate our findings through both writing and teaching. We need to de­fine terms and be clear about how we are using them. We need to provide examples. We need to accumulate a fund of shared knowledge. If we do not cast the problem being un­dertaken in language that can be understood, it will not be understood (cf. Genishi, 1992a).Furthermore, links to practice need to be carefully de­veloped. Our standard practice of including one paragraph at the beginning and/or the end of an article to specify the importance of findings for practice does not help the prac­titioner think about instruction. This convention requires too much work for anyone who does not speak the language of research and has no experience inferring the implica­tions of research for practice.Yet another approach to coordinating research and prac­tice involves enabling and expecting teachers to be better prepared to value, seek, and accommodate research find­ings. Preservice teachers need more than a quick brush with and understanding of student development (Sigel,1990) in order for it to provide the kind of basis from which they can be problem solvers and, in turn, model problem solving in their classrooms (Renninger, 1996). We need to recognize that our own teaching reflects and communicates our conceptions of how learning works. Using the assigned text as the basis of a lecture suggests something quite different to students than does asking them to pose self­questions at the outset of a lecture, and then at its conclu­sion, asking them to work on answering these questions with other people sitting nearby.Finally, coordination of research and practice requires patience. The process of change is not swift if real change is to take place. Coordinating research and practice in de­velopmental psychology and instruction, furthermore, in­volves a shift in both fields to acknowledge the importance of the learning of each student and teacher. For both re­searchers and teachers, this shift involves reconstructing working knowledge about what is currently known about how students and teachers learn and the implications of this for how students might be taught. It also means being prepared to acknowledge and revise current working knowledge based on what is learned from practitioners, as well as from subsequent research efforts. In this way, re­search in developmental psychology will not only come from practice, but it will be understood as essential to practice.APPENDIX: A SECOND CASE IN TWO FORMATSThis appendix provides the reader with a second case in two formats. The topic, the Colonization of North Amer­ica, is more mainstream than that of the Jurassic Period; however, like the lecture and interactive formats of that case, both formats described here are examples of instruc­tion that would challenge students, albeit differently. Pre­senting a second case in two formats is intended to enable the interested reader to consider more fully yet another ex­ample of a lecture and an interactive format and the neces­sary characteristics of each.Lecture FormatThe organization of the course is chronological, starting with the European settlement of North America. Materials for the lecture include references to and overheads of orig­inal source materials such as Sewell’s Diary, school primers, lists of materials shipped to the early settlers, and so on.260 Developmental Psychology and Instruction: Issues From and For PracticeThe teacher begins the class with a pretest to find out what the students know. The information from the test is then used in selecting materials for lectures on which the students take notes. The assignment for the first evening in­volves reading the first chapter in the text and summarizing it in one page. The homework assignment enables students to elaborate upon the information presented in class and re­quires them to read with enough comprehension to be able to produce a summary of the chapter. Students summaries allow further consideration of what they have understood to date and what they still do not understand.Interactive FormatThe organization of the course is largely chronological; however, it begins with an introduction to history and the skills of the historian in the present day, then moves back in time to discuss the European settlement of North America. The first class starts with a brief overview of the course content, after which the teacher asks the students to say what they know about the early settlers, and to brainstorm about what history is. The teacher uses the information gleaned during the brainstorm to understand the level and breadth of the students’ prior knowledge. This information is then used to inform selection of tasks, level of question­ing, and so on for the first days of the course.Materials for the course include original source materi­als such as Sewell’s Diary, school primers, lists of materi­als shipped to the early settlers, and so on. Class work consists of short lectures interspersed with a variety of ac­tivities that permit students to explore the concepts central to U.S. history and the nature of questions asked by histo­rians. Students keep weekly journals in which they reflect about an historian’s questions. The teacher provides ques­tions to help students reflect on such questions in their journals. After several weeks, these questions become in­creasingly open ended, and support for the students re­flections is no longer necessary.The teacher starts the class by asking students to work with a person sitting beside them to make lists of all of the kinds of things an historian does. These are shared with the class and written on the board—the teacher decides which of these options to follow based on both the students’ facil­ity in generating the list of what they know and the extent of their abilities to listen to each other as different ideas are suggested. Following this, the teacher uses this infor­mation to review the students’ job for the year: to sharpen their skills as historians as they study U.S. history.Students then move right into talking about all of the things they know about U.S. history. Standing back fromthe board, the teacher asks how to organize this informa­tion; alternatively, the teacher can ask students to work in groups of three to develop categories for talking about all of the information on the board. Students share informa­tion and categories are written on the board. Students are then asked to write in what will be their journal for the class about what an historian does and to list the categories they consider to be the most useful avenues for furthering their understanding of U.S. history.The assignment for the first evening involves listening to a news broadcast or finding an article in the newspaper that is an example of history in the making, and writing a summary of it to be shared with the class. This assignment provides a foundation for the next class, which focuses on source materials and perspectives, and it begins the pro­cess of anchoring the study of U.S. history in the present. It also permits the teacher to learn something about how students follow through on an assignment, their ability to express themselves, and whether they know what a sum­mary is.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSI would like to acknowledge the many contributions my stu­dents, the teachers with whom I have worked, and my col­leagues have made to my thinking about the links (and gaps) between the field of developmental psychology and instruc­tional practice.
